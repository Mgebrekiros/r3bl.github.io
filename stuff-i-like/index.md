I decided to ditch the classic blogroll, so in this page, I will present you the list of softwares, services, organizations and blogs that I particularly like and use or visit on a regular basis. This page is regularly updated, so keep an eye on it from time to time. I have to warn you that this is a pretty big list, so I've decided to organize it in four different categories.

1. <a href="#software">My Software Pack</a>
2. <a href="#web-services">My Web Services Pack</a>
3. <a href="#organizations">Organizations and Foundations I Support</a>
4. <a href="#blogs">The List of Blogs I'm Reading</a>

<a name="software">My Software Pack</a>

* [elementary OS](http://elementaryos.org/) -> elementary OS has been my favorite operating system for a long time now. Since I installed it for the first time, I never looked back.
* [Mozilla Firefox](https://affiliates.mozilla.org/referral/69489/) -> Mozilla Firefox is by far my favorite browser. I just can't imagine myself using anything else.
* [Mozilla Thunderbird](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/) -> When it comes to emailing, There's no better tool than Thunderbird. Too bad Mozilla stopped developing new features for it.
* [Atom](https://atom.io/) -> Atom is my favorite text editor. I use it for pretty much everything. It practically replaced my text editor, my IDE and my Office suite in most of the cases.
* [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/) -> LibreOffice is my favorite office pack and I really like using it. Plus, the design of LibreOffice is awesome once you switch your style to [Sifr](http://www.webupd8.org/2014/01/libreoffice-42-released-with-new.html).
* [Todo.txt](http://todotxt.com/) -> I got tired of all of those complicated to use to-do services and apps. That's why I switched to Todo.txt to keep myself organized. I'm using [QTodoTxt](https://github.com/mNantern/QTodoTxt) on my elementary OS.
* [qBittorrent](http://www.qbittorrent.org/) -> Why the hell μTorrent has so many users when qBittorrent does the job even better? Plus, it has no ads and it's bundled with a few extra features such as sequential download.
* [Popcorn Time](http://popcorntime.io/) -> Everyone needs some relaxation, and that is when Popcorn Time steps in. A clean intuitive interface that's integrated perfectly allows me to watch movies and TV shows any time I want to. It's not my fault that there are no Netflix-like platforms available in my country.
* [Pidgin](http://pidgin.im/) -> Pidgin is the reason why I'm no longer opening Facebook. Twitter is my go-to social network and I use Pidgin to chat with my Facebook friends without opening Facebook at all.
* [Terminator](http://gnometerminator.blogspot.com/p/introduction.html) -> When I'm doing something that requires from me to type commands inside of my terminal, Terminator is there to get the job done.
* [TrueCrypt](https://truecrypt.ch/) -> Although officially not supported anymore, I'm still using it on a regular basis. I just can't find any Windows and Linux compatible software to get the job done better than TrueCrypt.
* [Clementine](https://www.clementine-player.org/) -> I love listening to DI.fm and SomaFM, and those services are perfectly integrated with Clementine right out of the box. Although I'm not a big fan of the Clementine interface, it gets the job done.

<a name="web-services">My Web Services Pack</a>

* [GitHub](https://github.com/) -> I love every single feature GitHub offers, which is why [GitHub is my favorite company](http://r3bl.github.io/en/why-github-is-my-favorite-company/).
* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/) -> I use Twitter regularly. It replaced Facebook as my "default" social network.
* [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/) -> Reddit is a place where I get my inspiration. There are some amazing Subreddits out there for anybody.
* [HackerNews](https://news.ycombinator.com/news) -> HackerNews is an excellent resource to keep up to date with the latest technology.
* [Digg](http://digg.com/) -> Digg is a great add-free web service that allows me to keep up with the latest posts from my favorite blogs and news services.
* [Kindle](https://read.amazon.com/) -> I have over 200 books in my Kindle library and I enjoy reading them using online version of the Kindle Reader.
* [RescueTime](https://www.rescuetime.com/) -> Although pretty unknown, RescueTime is a great service that allows you to check how much of the time I spend on my laptop is actually spent on doing something productive. And thanks to their great cross-platform apps, I forget that I'm running them until I get a weekly summary delivered to my mail.
* [MEGA](https://mega.co.nz/) -> Even though I have over 2 TB of space (1 TB on Mail.Ru Cloud and another one on OneDrive), the cloud service that I use regularly is MEGA, primarily because their Linux client is amazing.
* [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) -> I tried DuckDuckGo once and now I can't get enough of it. I'm using it all the time as my primary search engine, and I can't live without DuckDuckGo's bangs any more.
* [CareerDean](http://careerdean.com/) -> I love visiting this site from time to time. It's a site where people who are employed in some of the biggest technology companies around answer questions.
* [alternativeTo](http://alternativeto.net/) -> If you ever get tired of using a certain software and you're looking for alternatives, AlternativeTo is a place to go.
* [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) -> I strongly believe that education should be free and everyone who has the desire to learn should be able to finish courses offered by some of the best collages in the world. If you need to learn something new, Coursera is the place to go.
* [Open Culture](http://www.openculture.com/) -> This is the site where you can find _the most_ of the free learning materials available on the Internet.

<a name="organizations">Organizations and Foundations I Support</a>

* [The Mozilla Foundation](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/) -> I love Mozilla's goals and their mission and I'm using almost every product they offer.
* [SHARE Foundation](http://sharedefense.org/) -> Serbian nonprofit organization that supports privacy, free speech and transparency. They also have this amazing book called [Share This Book (2012)](http://www.shareconference.net/en/news/share-book).
* [Electronic Frontier Foundation](https://www.eff.org/) -> I strongly believe in EFF as the defense mechanism for the Internet. I support almost every campaign they make and I completely trust that they know what's best for the privacy-aware Internet users.
* [Creative Commons](http://creativecommons.org/) -> I strongly believe that information should be free. That's why I'm releasing all of my articles under [CC-BY-SA license](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).
