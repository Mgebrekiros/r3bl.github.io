# Personal Blog

This is the repository with where I'm hosting my [personal blog](http://r3bl.github.io/).

The current version of the blog is created using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and [poole](https://github.com/poole/poole) by following this great [tutorial](http://joshualande.com/jekyll-github-pages-poole/) by [Joshua Lande](http://joshualande.com/).
