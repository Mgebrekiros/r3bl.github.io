  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>So, today I’m going to share with you a trick to DDoS a certain website by using Facebook’s notes feature. The process, although pretty simple, is a bit more complicated than previous posts I wrote in this series.</p>

<p>So, what do you need to do?</p>

<p>Well, first of all, you go to the target’s website and create a list with unique photos posted on that website. You put them in appropriate HTML tag like this:</p>

<p>&lt;img src=”http://targetname/file?r=1” /&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;img src=”http://targetname/file?r=2” /&gt;</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>&lt;img src=”http://targetname/file?r=1000” /&gt;</p>

<p>The next thing you need to do is to write a note on <a href="http://m.facebook.com/">m.facebook.com</a> (it’s a mobile version of Facebook).</p>

<p>Now, you need to duplicate that note a couple of times with one <em>or</em> several other Facebook accounts.</p>

<p>After you’ve done that, all you need to do is to open that notes at the same time and watch the site go down. This process will generate thousands of HTTP requests in a couple of seconds to the target site.</p>

<p>So, a few days ago, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pirate_Bay">The Pirate Bay</a> was raided. The site itself is still not online and we have no indications whether or not it <em>will</em> come back online. There’s a lot of fake sites that advertise themselves as The Pirate Bay, but are basically of no use (users can’t upload new torrents, the database of torrents is either too old or don’t work at all).</p>

<p>I myself can’t figure out do I want The Pirate Bay to stay down or to come back online. So, why am I saying that?</p>

<p>Well, first of all, the fact is that The Pirate Bay had a huge influence in making the world what it is today (I will probably cover that topic in some future blog post). But, lets be honest, the design of the website is way too old, the code behind the website is pretty outdated too, and there’s nothing new going on on the site itself for quite some time.</p>

<p>If we look at those flaws, we can basically say that the site itself got ran over by time. But don’t get me wrong, The Pirate Bay itself did an excellent job at what it was supposed to do. It had the biggest torrent collection available on the Internet, it had the biggest reputation amongst all other peer-to-peer (P2P) services, and it is one of the top 100 visited websites at the moment (<a href="http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/thepiratebay.se">according to Alexa</a>).</p>

<p>So, maybe it’s time for something new? <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Sunde">Peter Sunde</a>, co-founder and ex-spokesperson of The Pirate Bay definitely <a href="http://blog.brokep.com/2014/12/09/the-pirate-bay-down-forever/">agrees with me</a> on that.</p>

<blockquote>**Peter Sunde:** It feels good that it might have closed down forever, just a real shame the way it did that. A planned retirement would have given the community time and a way to kick off something new, something better, something faster, something more reliable and with no chance of corrupting itself. Something that had a soul and could retain it.</blockquote>

<p>Is the <a href="http://oldpiratebay.org/">Old Pirate Bay</a> exactly what we’re looking for? Old Pirate Bay is a search engine provided by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IsoHunt">Iso</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IsoHunt">hunt</a>, one of the biggest competitors to The Pirate Bay.</p>

<p>The design of the site feels like it’s an upgraded version of The Pirate Bay. The site works perfectly and the workflow of the site is pretty much the same as in The Pirate Bay.</p>

<p>I have to agree with Peter, it is time for The Pirate Bay to shutdown completely, and it is the time for the community to think of something new and original to revolutionize the way we share files. The Pirate Bay did it job perfectly for over a decade and now seems like a perfect time for it do disappear from the Internet. In the meantime, Old Pirate Bay seems like a pretty decent alternative.</p>

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>First of all, I do realize that I’m probably a few months late to talk about this topic. This topic is far from something new and something groundbreaking. Don’t believe me? Well, this video from Google now has well over 2 million views.</p>

<p>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8TXgCzxEnw</p>

<p>So, what exactly is material design? Well, it’s a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_language">design language</a> developed by Google. The whole point of this design language is that every graphical user interface should be as simple and colorful as possible. The point of that is, of course, to provide users with an interface which is pretty appealing to the eye.</p>

<p>Google already implemented material design in the newest version of Android called Lollipop. You can easily see the whole point of material design by looking at this excellent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLYE3fgWI_4">Android 5.0 Lollipop Review</a> done by <a href="http://www.theverge.com/">The Verge</a> guys. The plan for Google is to implement this design language to every single one of their services.</p>

<p>Linux community embraced the whole material design idea pretty quickly. So, we already have this thing called <a href="http://quantum-os.github.io/">Quantum OS</a> (previously known as Quartz OS). The point of this project is to create an operating system (which will probably be based on Arch Linux) that will follow Google’s own <a href="http://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html">material design guidelines</a>.</p>

<p>I remember reading somewhere that it’s not fair to the KDE community to say that they’ve implemented the material design because some of the KDE 5 mockups were out far before Google released the whole material design idea to the public. Anyway, KDE Plasma 5 does seem to fit the concept, as you can see by looking at one of the huge number of YouTube reviews if you search for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=kde+plasma+5">KDE Plasma 5</a>.</p>

<p>And now I came to the whole point of writing this post. I found out about a material design solution that I can implement right now using my current setup. As you may know already, I’m a huge <a href="http://elementaryos.org/">elementary OS</a> fan. elementary uses Pantheon as a DE, which is based on GNOME and uses GTK.</p>

<p>So, today, <a href="http://snwh.org/">Sam Hewitt</a> published the first GTK theme (at least that I know about) that was created with the goal of implementing the rules of material design. The theme is called <a href="http://snwh.org/paper/">Paper</a> and it’s in alpha stage at the moment. It looks wonderful and I’m pretty happy with how well the theme integrated with my elementary OS.</p>

<p><img src="http://snwh.org/paper/screenshot.png" alt="Screenshot" /></p>

<p>If you want to use it, all you need to do is to extract the folder called Paper in the tarball into your ‘/usr/share/themes’ directory and that’s it. If you experience some problems with the theme, <a href="https://github.com/snwh/paper-gtk-theme/issues">this</a> is the proper place to report bugs.</p>

<p>I hope that Sam will continue to work successfully on such a great GTK theme and that we will see more of the material design GTK themes soon!</p>

    <p>I like watching movies about hacking. There are only two possible outcomes of me watching this kind of movies: they’re fantastic OR they’re terrible. If the movie is fantastic, I’m going to enjoy it of course. But, if the movie is terrible, I’m going to laugh my ass of how stupidly hacking is displayed in that movie.</p>

<p>Well, this movie goes into that other group. It’s called <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3293462/">Algorithm</a> (like you haven’t seen that coming from the title of the post). I’m going to start my story by talking about how I found out about this movie.</p>

<p>A couple of hours ago I was just browsing my Twitter feed like I usually do. But this time, there was a certain link to a blog post that got my attention. It’s a post by <a href="http://www.brandxindustries.com/blog/?author=52efd1c5e4b0c02e5a3ad902">Jonathan Schiefer</a>, a writer and a director of this film. In a post titled <a href="http://www.brandxindustries.com/blog/2014/12/4/the-free-future-starts-now">The Free Future Starts Now</a>, he talks about how piracy changed the way he looks at his movie. He didn’t earn much from the movie (not even enough to compensate the money he spent making the movie), but still, he did something marvelous. He shared his movie with the world for free for 24 hours. He knew that after those 24 hours are over, the pirating of the movie is going to be unstoppable, but that didn’t stop him from doing that. Now, his movie is all over the internet, and he feels damn proud about that.</p>

<p>I’ve never done a movie review before (hell, I don’t remember even reading any), especially not in English (I’m just saying this because I’m not a native English speaker as you probably notices by now), but I will give it a go. That’s the least I can do for Jonathan and his excellent piece of work.</p>

<p>This is the first movie I ever rated on IMDb and it got a perfect 10 from me. The movie is a perfect example that you <em>can</em> make a movie about hacking without making something up. Everything I saw in this movie <em>is</em> possible, and that’s something that really impressed me. It’s something that made this movie stand up from the rest of the similar movies I saw. <em>Everything seems possible</em>. Although I didn’t like the way hackers are represented in the movie (I think of a hacker more in an ideological way, as someone who thinks outside the box, not as someone who breaks computer systems), I completely understand why Jonathan decided to represent hackers in such way.</p>

<p>This movie covers a story about a hacker (or if you’re like me, the term cracker might work better for you) who will try to break into anything he wants. He went out of line once and broke into some government database, which was a big mistake (of course). His friends were tortured by the government because of that and in the end he himself got tortured because a friend of his betrayed him. After they tortured him, the government <em>did</em> offer him a job, something that would probably happen if this was a real life situation (think of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hector_Xavier_Monsegur">Sabu</a> as a perfect example). I don’t want to spoil everything so I’m not going to say anything more about the story. I highly suggest you to pirate the movie if you’re interested.</p>

<p>What I liked even more than the story was the way the technology was described in the movie. He talks about Linux, about Tor browser, the disadvantages of the open WiFi network, the disadvantages of proprietary programming languages, and the main ideology of every hacker: that the information should be free.</p>

<p>Jonathan even went one step ahead as he adopted those words from the movie in the real life by sharing the movie with the world.</p>

<p>As he said in the blog post I linked, it all started with the software. Then came the books. Next stop was sharing the music. Now, we’re at a stage where sharing movies is something we encounter with on a regular basis. And the next stop is going to be sharing small physical objects (by using 3D printers).</p>

<p>I’m going to end the post by sharing the last couple of sentences from the post Jonathan published, because I really think that those sentences cover it all:</p>

<p>“_When everything is free there won’t be any poor. There won’t be any wealth inequalities. There won’t be people starving because anyone can just print food. People won’t go into debt for the rest of their life to go to college because we’ll have equal access to information and art. There will be no tricking the ignorant because people won’t be ignorant because information will be free. _</p>

<p><em>I’m crazy enough to believe I can help change the world. And the world I want is when the future is free!”</em></p>

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Today I learned that gaming on Linux is still not very noob friendly. For a long while now I was looking for a first game to buy in my life. I’ve decided for Wither 2: Assassins of Kings. The game costs somewhere near $20 on <a href="http://www.gog.com/">GOG</a> and I got the 60% discount deal so the game cost me $7.99 total.</p>

<p>The game itself is big, and I mean <em>really _big. I needed to download over 19 gigabytes, but what the heck, I bought it because I wanted to play it, so I went ahead and started the download. On the first try, download failed after 3,5 GB with no apparent reason. My internet connection did not break or anything like that. I felt discouraged but I wanted to give it another go, so I started to download the game, _again</em>. This time, I downloaded more than 7 GB of data and the download crashed again for no apparent reason.</p>

<p>There is no official GOG’s Linux download manager for now, but after some searching around I did manage to find the unofficial one called <a href="https://github.com/Sude-/lgogdownloader/">lgogdownloader</a> (thank you GitHub!). So I went ahead and installed it. It’s a fine command line tool and it’s not really hard to figure it out. After spending a half an hour connecting it with my GOG account (don’t blame the developer of this tool, the fault is all mine) the time has come for me to try to download the game for the third time now.</p>

<p>This time, download was successfully finished and I had the game on my hard drive. Wow, finally, looks like I’m going to be able to play it! So after I extracted the whole 19 gigs of compressed data to a folder I felt very excited. Now all I had to do is to start the game and I’ll be able to play it, right?</p>

<p>Well, of course not.</p>

<p>I know what is a launcher file, so I thought that all I needed to do is to give execution privileges to that file and the game should start, right? Well, no, the launcher didn’t start because of some broken dependency. Thanks to the Ubuntu’s huge repository, installing the dependency was not that big of a deal, just a standard <em>apt-get install</em> command. After that I will finally start the game and that would be it.</p>

<p><strong>Aaaand finally, the launcher started without any errors in the terminal!</strong></p>

<p>Now all I needed to do is to click on Launch Ga… WHAT??? Broken dependency, again? Oh what the hell, <em>sudo apt-get install libsdl2-2.0</em> should do the trick, right? All done, it’s time to <em>finally</em> start the game, right?</p>

<p>WHAT??? The same error <em>again</em>? But I <em>have</em> installed <em>libsdl2-__2.0</em>! Back to Firefox and search for the issue. Oh, so I installed the 64-bit version of the package but I need the 32-bit version to start the game? Sure, no problem, repeating the last command with _:i386 _in the end should do the trick. Start the game again, aaand get a broken dependency error again!</p>

<p>So looks like I need one more package? OK, this time I won’t repeat the same error, I’ll install the 32-bit version right away. Now I have to admit that after going through such trouble, I do feel kind of frustrated and I just want to play the damn game. My inner hacker is exhausted so he took a nap and woke up 50-year-old grudged man inside of me from the couch. Let’s see if he can finish the installation.</p>

<p>Of course, GOG laughs at my face and gives me another broken dependency. This time it’s a package called <em>openal</em>. Sure, no problem, <em>sudo apt-get install openal</em>. What, not in the repository? Let’s try to Google that. So I did manage to find the renamed package. Looks like it’s called <em>libopenal0a</em>, so let’s install it. <em>sudo apt-get install libopenal0a</em>. Wait, no release candidate? Let’s Google some more. And while I’m searching for the solution, let’s look at GOG’s support, might want to contact them if something goes wrong.</p>

<p>So, the officially supported distros are Ubuntu and Linux Mint. Oh, crap, I’m not using <em>them</em>, I’m using <a href="http://elementaryos.org/">elementary OS</a>! I don’t think that the support will be willing to help me out, but they do have <em>some</em> articles posted in their support section and elementary _is _built on top of Ubuntu 14.04, so I might check out those articles while I’m already at the support section.</p>

<p>Question: <em>How do I start the game I unpacked from a tarball (*.tar.gz)?
_Solution: _Run ./start.sh</em></p>

<p>Oh, wait a second, I don’t have any shell scripts inside my Witcher folder, but I do have the launcher, which is practically the same, right?</p>

<p>Question: <em>Why do you list required libraries on the game’s product card?
_Solution: _… We’ll always make sure to include a list of any potentially missing libraries that make up a game’s minimum system requirements.</em></p>

<p>Thank you GOG! So all I have to do is to find minimum system requirements and I’ll find the list of all packages I need to install and then I’ll be able to run the game! I remember I saw a file called <em>readme_EN.rtf</em> inside of my Witcher folder. So I opened it up and navigated to system requirements section.</p>

<p>What??? Linux is not even on this list??? Only requirements for Windows? What the hell? Back to Google-ing. Oh, marvelous! <a href="http://www.webupd8.org/2014/05/the-witcher-2-assassins-of-kings-game.html">Webupd8’s article</a> about the game release for Linux does contain the system requirements section. Now let’s look for that list of packages I need. WAIT WHAT??? THE GAME ONLY SUPPORTS NVIDIA GPUs??? WHY IS THAT INFO NOT SHARED ON GOG’s SITE???</p>

<p>Oh, it is. Crap.</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>OK, calm down.</p>

<p><em>cd ..
rm -r the_witcher_2</em></p>

<p>Note to myself: Next time, buy the damn game on Steam.</p>

<p><strong>DISCLAIMER:</strong> I love GOG, this text is not an attack on them in any way. This is just a satire text to show you my stupidity.</p>
