  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Artificial Intelligence is not only <em>going to</em> change the world. It already <em>has</em> changed the world. There’s a lot of difference between those two statements.</p>

<p>To talk about this, first, we need to agree on what Artificial Intelligence really is. As with the pretty much every single topic that has ever existed, there are <em>plenty</em> of different definitions on what AI really is.</p>

<p>You can consider AI to be a human-like robot that operates and thinks as a human, but you will be wrong. You can consider AI to be a computer with feelings, and you will, once again, be wrong.</p>

<p>So, lets start this article by defining AI as a hardware + software combination (or just a software) that takes the input data, processes it in some way that no human intelligence could ever be capable of doing, and then returns the output to the user. Now, you might argue with me that this definition does not represent AI and that it only represents what every single computer program is made for, but I think that you will be wrong.</p>

<p>We currently do not have any all-purpose AI solution. What this means is that every algorithm and every robot is built with the specific purpose in mind. Take it and put it in some other environment, the one that the programmers and/or engineers haven’t thought of while they were building it, and you got yourself a pretty useless piece of software (+ hardware in some cases).</p>

<p>To get back to the subject, I strongly think that AI is not something that <em>is going to</em> change the future. I think that it already has. It is only going to increase the way it changes us and the world around us following the Moore’s law.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Moore’s law is the observation that the power of the computer doubles approximately every two years.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now there are some different definitions of how long does it take to the computer power to double. Some say that this process lasts only a year, some say that lasts 18 months, and others say that it lasts for two years. The point is that the computer power is increasing constantly at a <em>very</em> fast rate.</p>

<h3 id="so-how-is-the-world-around-us-changed-with-the-ai">So, how is the world around us changed with the AI?</h3>

<p>First of all, we all got smartphones in our pockets. I know, you’re probably tired of hearing this, but todays low-end smartphones <em>are</em> more powerful than the supercomputers we had as recently as 20 years ago, and we can’t even properly compare the physical size of them (one of them being as big as a room and the other being small enough to fit in a pocket). So, lets take Siri for an example. She is powerful, not powerful enough as a “regular” personal assistant (and by regular I mean human), but she is getting better and better. Her biggest flaw definitely is the speech recognition, which is quite a challenging topic in AI. It is a fine example of AI that runs <em>from your phone</em>.</p>

<p>Next example: Google Search. Long time ago, Google stopped offering all around search results and started memorizing what we searched for in the past and started using it to predict the topics we’re interested in searching. As an example, as you might already know, I have hosted my blog for almost six months using my <a href="https://aleksandartodorovic.wordpress.com/">Wordpress.com domain</a>. After that, I have decided to ditch it and to start using my <a href="http://r3bl.github.io/">current domain</a> together with Jekyll blogging platform. After I’ve started searching for some Jekyll tweaks and themes, I kept finding Wordpress tweaks as my top results. This type of AI is not easily recognizable, the search results vary only a little, but it is happening and you are using AI every time you use Google’s search provider. Try looking up your name from two different devices (both running different Google accounts) and see it for yourself.</p>

<p>Next stop: Google Glass and Google’s self-driving vehicles. After that: that annoying Facebook algorithm that “predicts” people you should add to your friends based on your common interests, your location and with the interaction with your mutual friends. Face recognition? Of course, AI (and it is getting pretty good with it). YouTube video suggestions? Again, AI. Evernote tags? AI. Facebook timeline? AI. Cleverbot? (A pretty stupid use of) AI. Stock markets? We now have AI platforms that advises us which stocks should we buy and which stocks should we sell.</p>

<p>You see, everything we do online <em>is</em> starting to be enhanced by AI. That line is not going to decrease over time, it is only going to increase at an exponential rate (as seen in the picture I showed as an example below).</p>

<p><img src="http://www.regentsprep.org/regents/math/algebra/AE7/fixpic2.gif" alt="exponential growth" /></p>

<h3 id="so-what-could-we-expect-in-the-near-future">So, what could we expect in the near future?</h3>

<p>Ray Kurzweil is probably the biggest futurist alive. He has received 20 honorary doctorates and he has been awarded by three U.S. presidents. He published seven books, five of which have been national bestsellers. He already predicted some of our achievements and when they’re going to happen. He predicted that computers will be able to beat chess masters in (you guessed it) chess, that we will have WiFi broadly implemented across the world, that there will be self-driving vehicles reaching consumerism (OK, we still have a few years ahead of this, but does anyone really doubt it?), that we will find a way to project images right before our eyes… The list goes on and on. Following Moore’s law, he predicted even more amazing things in the next 25 years.</p>

<p>He predicts that we will be able to fight most of the known diseases by using nanobots. He predicts that the virtual reality is going to feel 100% real by the 2030s. He says that we will reach a point of singularity probably around 2029. He predicts that the line between the reality and the virtual reality is going to blur out.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Singularity is the hypothesis that accelerating progress in technologies will cause a runaway effect wherein artificial intelligence will exceed human intellectual capacity and control, thus radically changing civilization in an event called the singularity.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="will-ai-destoy-us">Will AI destoy us?</h3>

<p>This is probably the most misleading statement in the field of AI. And it is pretty simple to figure out why. We have tons of movies with scenarios in which we created something so powerful that it considered us just as a threat and destroyed us. Take <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2209764/">Transcendence (2014)</a> as an example (although it doesn’t blindly follow that pattern). But I don’t think that anyone who knows something about AI agrees with it. You see, for the machine to become intelligent, first we need to program it. And I don’t think that anyone with the capacity of creating the real AI is going to try to dominate the world in any way. Our biggest bet probably relies on some huge company like IBM or Google, and I don’t think that they’re going to make such an awful mistake. Most of the AI scientissts and futurists agree with me on that. After all, the goal of AI is not to kill every potential buyer out there. The goal of creating AI is to create something that will exceed human intelligence and help us to find some answers to the questions we’re struggling with for a very long time.</p>

<p>Well, this was actually not a part of my goals for 2015, but it <em>is</em> something that I thought of in the meantime.</p>

<p>I love learning and I love dedicating my free time to learn something new. Currently, I’m really enjoying learning about artificial intelligence, which is definitely one of the most promising technology-related topics there is. I’m intrigued and amazed by every single new line that I read about it and I’m probably going to keep up with the learning of artificial intelligence for quite some time.</p>

<p>So, today, it got me wondered, why not pledge to learn something new every single day?</p>

<p>And I really mean <em>every</em>. <em>single</em>. <em>day</em>. No breaks, no vacations, no nothing. I love learning and I have developed a habit of learning something new at least once a week. So, why don’t I kick it up a notch?</p>

<p>Starting from today (well, actually, I have been learning something new for a few days in a row now), I’ve decided to learn something new every single day out of the topics I’m interested in. I’ve devoted my last month into getting quite a lot of books that are interesting to me, so now, I’m going to start reading them a day after day. One page a day is better than none.</p>

<p>I want to build a healthy habit that could help me throughout my career and this is the way of accomplishing it I’m completely comfortable with.</p>

<p>So, starting from today, you can expect me to push at least one commit to <a href="https://github.com/aleksandar-todorovic/notes/">my notes repository</a> every day. That repository already has over 5,000 words written in it and the list is only going to get bigger and bigger as I’m going to research as much interesting topics as possible.</p>

<p>During the weekends, I’m going to review my notes from the previous week, simplifying them and shortening them if needed. After I start to organize my time in an efficient way, I’m going to start to <a href="http://ejohn.org/blog/write-code-every-day/">write code every day</a>, and, in a couple of months, I should know much more than I know currently in a wide variety of topics.</p>

<p>I should emphasize that my goal is not to become an expert in a specific topic. My goal is to have a reasonable amount of knowledge in every single topic I can think of. My goal is to stop asking myself how something works. My goal is to start <em>learning</em> how something works on a daily basis.</p>

<p>Who knows, if I work <em>really</em> hard, I might even be able to get a summer internship in some company that I deeply admire.</p>

<p>At the end of the post, I’m going to share my short-term goals with the public, to make sure that I make them a reality and to get an even higher inspiration:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Pass every subject from my first semester in the first half of February (two of them left, my finals are starting in five days).</li>
  <li>Start the coding challenge that I’ve mentioned before by the end of February.</li>
  <li>Pass every subject from my second semester by the end of the first half of April (again, only two of them left).</li>
  <li>Have a decent amount of knowledge in artificial intelligence by the end of May.</li>
  <li>Have a decent amount of proficiency in C / C++ / Vala by the end of June.</li>
</ul>

<p>I’m going to update this post every time I accomplish a goal I stated here by adding a check mark (✓) next to it. And, of course, every time I learn something interesting worthy of posting, I will put an update my blog.</p>

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Počeo sam da sumnjam kada sam krenuo u prvi razred srednje škole. Išao sam u poprilično jedno-religijsku osnovnu školu, i poslije toga sam se preselio u Brčko, poznato kao jedan od rijetkih gradova gdje sve tri nacionalnosti iz BiH živi zajedno. U početku savršeno, kasnije noćna mora. Iako se ljudi prave da nema podjele, srednjoškolci jedne nacionalnosti idu u jedan kafić, srednjoškolci druge u drugi kafić, srednjoškolci treće vjere u treći kafić. I to je postalo sasvim normalno. Da se razumijemo, ne kažem da su svi posjetioci ta tri kafića koje pominjem bili te vjere, ali procenat je poprilično ogroman da bi se zanemario.</p>

<p>Odbijajući da se ograničim na to sa kojim ću se ljudima družiti na osnovu njihove religije, često sam bio kritikovan i odbacivan od “svojih” ljudi. Zbog te odbačenosti na neki način, počeo sam da dobijam averziju prema svojoj vjeri i u “hakerskom” duhu, krenuo sam da istražujem. Na jedan papir sam u dvije kolone napisao usporedbe o određenim shvatanjima iz Biblije sa znanstvenim zaključcima. Shvatio sam da se ne slažem sa mnogo stvari iz Biblije, i kao neko ko je zapravo pročitao Bibliju (budimo realni, većina vjernika je nikada i ne pročita), postao sam svjestan da ljudi citate uzimaju iz konteksta, uzimajući ono što im odgovara, odbacujući dijelove Biblije koji im ne odgovaraju. To je po meni bilo pogrešno. Ne možeš jedan dio svete knjige da poštuješ, drugi ne. Ili idi na sve, ili ne idi na ništa.</p>

<p>Presudan trenutak je za mene bio jedan sasvim običan dan kada sam gledao jedan od nastupa preminulog komičara George Carlin-a. Onda je došao ovaj dio, koji je bukvalno bio okidač u mom slučaju. Preko noći, prestao sam da ispitujem svoju religiju i odlučio da je odbacim. Proces “prelaska” je trajao čitavu moju srednju školu, a kada sam završio srednju školu, i taj proces je bio završen.</p>

<iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8r-e2NDSTuE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>Danas, skoro tri godine kasnije, trpim posljedice. Na popisu stanovništva u BiH, ispitivač je odbio da upiše Bosanac ateista kao moju nacionalnost i religiju. Nastala je svađa, i na kraju sam pod pritiskom od strane roditelja i popisivača ipak potpisao papir na kojem piše da sam Srbin pravoslavac, nešto čemu sam se strogo protivio u tom trenutku, i još uvijek se protivim.</p>

<p>Nedavno sam našao jednu prelijepu curu i zaljubio se. Prekinuli smo kada su njeni saznali moje ime i prezime, automatski misleći o meni da sam Srbin pravoslavac na osnovu imena, ni ne popričavši sa mnom i odbacujući svaku mogućnost da sam nešto drugačije od onoga šta moje ime predstavlja. Razlog zašto im moja (sada već bivša) cura nije rekla moje pravo opredjeljenje jeste zato što bi “bilo još gore” (pod navodnicima ne zato što se ne slažem sa rečenim, nego da stavim u konekst u kojem sam doživio te riječi).</p>

<p>Da se razumijemo, ovo nije prvi put da mi se to dogodilo i ovo je već četvrta ili peta veza koja se završila na potpuno isti način (opisan u pseudokodu koji će svako razumjeti):</p>

<pre><code>cura kaže roditeljima moje ime
povežu me sa nacijom i religijom
ukoliko je moja nacija drugačija od njene
    pritišću je na to da odustane
    ukoliko ona još uvijek zavisi od njih
        popušta pri pritisku.
</code></pre>

<p>Samo, ova me je do sada na neki način najviše pogodila, te za mene ostavila potrebu da se na neki način “istresem”, odlučio sam se za ovaj način.</p>

<p>Dalje, posao. Primljen u kafić da konobarišem, kontao dobro će mi doći malo para sa strane, nema puno posla pa se mogu fokusirati na fakultet kada nema gostiju. Tokom godina, počevši od srednje pa do sada, naučio sam da se ne obazirem na imena. U početku mi je bilo čudno, vrlo čudno upoznati osobu koja se zove Emir, Aldina, Amar, Medina, Hajrudin, Albin, Edita i slično. U ovo vrijeme, počeo sam da ogluvljujem na imena, ne identifikovajući ih odma kao naciju i vjeru, nego isključivo kao osobu sa možda potpuno drugačijom pričom. Na tom poslu nisam ni primjetio da su su svi zaposleni, kao i šefovi i gosti koji dolaze tamo, zapravo svi jedne vjere. U prvoj prilici kada je to gazda napomenuo govoreći o konkurentnom kafiću kako ne može da vjeruje da neke osobe radije idu tamo nego ovdje (jer pobogu, tamo je gazda Bošnjak!), počeo sam da se oglušujem na naredbe i ubrzo dao otkaz, na pomalo nepredviđen način, ali dokazao sam da sa takvim osobama jednostavno ne mogu “poslovati” (malo grub termin uzimajući u obzir (ne)ozbiljnost ovog posla).</p>

<p>Danas se distanciram od ljudi koje smatram lošim, bez obzira na naciju i vjeru. Nisam ograničen nijednom “svetom knjigom”, te uživam u tome da čitam različite teorije na ovu temu, bez straha da ću zbog svoje radoznalosti biti mučen “do kraja vremena” (šta god taj pojam predstavljao). Imam dosta otvoreno društvo od 20ak ljudi koje jednostavno boli k… za religiju i naciju, te ih većina ili ima sumnje ili u potpunosti odbacuje svoju religiju, ipak poštujući one koji vjeruju.</p>

<p>Još jedna stvar koju mi je omogućio ovaj pritisak na mene od strane “mojih” i “onih ostalih” jeste taj da se prestanem toliko brinuti o mislima ostalih (u koje sada za mene spadaju i “moji” i “tuđi”) i da se fokusiram na lični uspjeh. Dok ja radim na sebi, oni pričaju o meni, stagnirajući na potpuno istom mjestu iz dana u dan.</p>

<p>Poenta je: Uspio sam se osloboditi tih okova koje mi je društvo nametalo. Postao sam slobodan čovjek, istražujući i fokusirajući se na svoje znanje, odbijajući da prihvatim bilo kakvo ograničenje koje mi neko postavi. Doživljavam neke posljedice sa vremena na vrijeme zbog toga, međutim nema te posljedice koja može da nadmaši sve dobro što mi je sloboda donijela. Počevši sa vjerom, prešao sam i na druge stvari u životu, tako da sam sada uspješno izgradio svoje lično ja, koje je potpuno drugačije od društveno prihvatljive norme.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Društvena norma je biti pripadnik neke vjere =&gt; ja sam ateista.</li>
  <li>Društvena norma je slušati narodnjake =&gt; ja partijam vikendima i na neki način se i bavim elektronskom muzikom.</li>
  <li>Društvena norma je biti ograničen na Windows =&gt; ja sam zakleti Linux-aš.</li>
</ul>

<p>Dakle, za mene je odbacivanje vjere bio jedan (a i najvažniji) od koraka koje sam prešao pri kreiranju svoje ličnosti, odbacujući ono što drugi žele od mene i fokusirajući se na to šta ja želim od sebe.</p>

<p>Na kraju, želim da citiram sam sebe (koliko god to glupo zvučalo) tako što što ću navesti jednu rečenicu koju obožavam da izgovaram:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Možda nisam najljepši, možda nisam najzgodniji, možda imam svoje poroke, međutim, imam mozak i znam kako da ga iskoristim.</p>

  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Wordpress was a great platform for the beginning of my blogging experience. The simplicity needed for the creation and maintaining of the Wordpress blog is amazing. It literally took me 10 minutes from the creation of my blog to my first post. But, a few days ago, I’ve decided that it is time for me to switch to something more powerful. I’ve decided to switch to Jekyll blogging platform.</p>

<h3 id="why-have-i-chosen-github--jekyll-as-my-new-platform">Why have I chosen GitHub + Jekyll as my new platform?</h3>

<p>Well, first of all, my PHP knowledge is <em>very</em> limited. I have always considered PHP to be the weakest spot in my education. And, on top of that, I’m not that comfortable with databases for now. Jekyll has allowed me to run a completely self-maintained blog without using any PHP or MySQL.</p>

<h3 id="using-this-combo-is-going-to-boost-my-github-profile-and-my-git-knowledge">Using this combo is going to boost my GitHub profile <em>and</em> my Git knowledge</h3>

<p>Because of the excellent Jekyll integration with GitHub pages, maintaining a blog using Jekyll is going to force me to use GitHub even more than I have used it so far. And I think that is great. By doing so, I’m going to visit GitHub more often, which will boost my desire to hack and program new things (<a href="https://github.com/personal-assistant/pa-wiki#personal-assistant">this</a> is the newest project I’m planing on making a reality).</p>

<p>It will also boost my GitHub profile in the search results, which is something I desperately need to do. While Google-ing my full name, I found out that there’s <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0865390/">an actor</a>, <a href="http://aleksandartodorovic.com/">a photographer</a> and a war criminal with the same name as mine. You can imagine the surprise of my future employer if he sees my name associated with a term such as a war criminal.</p>

<h3 id="i-love-every-single-product-that-github-developed-over-the-years">I love every single product that GitHub developed over the years</h3>

<p>Lets be honest, <a href="http://r3bl.github.io/en/why-github-is-my-favorite-company/">GitHub is my favorite company</a> and I love every single feature they’ve developed over the years. I love their tight integration with Git,  their pages, their Gists, their <a href="http://atom.io/">Atom text editor</a> and their <a href="https://education.github.com/pack">Student Developer Pack</a> (even though my request is still in the verification process).</p>

<h3 id="markdown-has-become-my-favorite-markup-language">Markdown has become my favorite markup language</h3>

<p>Ever since I’ve started using GitHub more regularly, I’m amazed by the simplicity behind Markdown. I’m using it to type everything from by blog posts to my collage papers and essays. Now, to be honest, I’ve written most of my posts using Markdown even back when in my Wordpress days, but Jekyll allows me to update my blog in an incredibly simple way. I just have to write my post inside of a new Markdown file, update my repository and that’s it. I don’t even have to open Firefox to post something.</p>

<h3 id="an-option-to-choose-a-commenting-platform">An option to choose a commenting platform</h3>

<p>Lets be honest, if you need comments on your website, Disqus is the way to go. Most of the sites I’m visiting are using it, and I see no reason of why I should choose anything else.</p>

<h3 id="i-love-having-the-full-control-over-my-blog">I love having the full control over my blog</h3>

<p>Worpress.com is a free platform and as such it does have some advantages and some limitations. Even though I loved the simplicity of some feature (like a Wordpress stats feature), I hated the way I was limited in the customization of my blog. Using this combination, I have no limitation that I’m uncomfortable with. I can customize my blog in any way I want and it feels great! Every Jekyll customization, every theme and every plugin I ran into were completely free (as in both speech <em>and</em> beer) and because of that I can customize every single aspect of them as I wish.</p>

<h3 id="so-how-will-i-make-the-transition-happen">So, how will I make the transition happen?</h3>

<p>Now this is a tricky one. I <em>have</em> decided that I’m going to be using this combination permanently, but I <em>do</em> have a lot of work to do before making the final switch.</p>

<p>First of all, there are still some parts of this excellent <a href="https://mmistakes.github.io/hpstr-jekyll-theme/">HPSTR Jekyll theme</a> that I haven’t customized properly (or <em>at all</em>). This is why I’m regularly updating a <a href="https://github.com/r3bl/r3bl.github.io/blob/master/TODO.md">TODO.md</a> file to remind myself of what still needs to be done.</p>

<p>So, if you like my blog, I encourage you to go through that TODO.md file and to report any issues that I haven’t noticed inside of that file <a href="https://github.com/r3bl/r3bl.github.io/issues">here</a>.</p>

<p>In the meantime, I’m going to post on <a href="https://aleksandartodorovic.wordpress.com/">my old platform</a> and <a href="http://r3bl.github.io/">my new platform</a> until I’m completely satisfied with the switch. I have also started posting my most interesting articles on Medium not too long ago, so you might want to <a href="https://medium.com/@r3bl">check that out</a> as well.</p>

<p>You can expect some great new things like SSL support, my own domain and a fully customized home page in the near future. And, in the spirit of open source software, every single line of code <a href="https://github.com/r3bl/r3bl.github.io">is available</a> for you to fork and use in your project in any way you want.</p>

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>The edited version of this article is posted on <a href="http://opensource.com/">Opensource.com</a>: <a href="http://opensource.com/life/15/2/beginners-guide-github">A beginner’s guide to GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>In this post I’m going to share with you a few reasons why I consider GitHub as my favorite technology-related company. If you still don’t know what GitHub is, you should continue reading this article because I’m going to share with you some of the most popular features GitHub has integrated in their service.</p>

<p><a href="https://aleksandartodorovic.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/github_logo.png"><img src="https://aleksandartodorovic.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/github_logo.png?w=300" alt="GitHub logo" /></a></p>

<h2 id="what-is-github">What is GitHub?</h2>

<blockquote>GitHub is a web-based Git repository hosting service, which offers all of the distributed revision control and source code management (SCM) functionality of Git as well as adding its own features.</blockquote>

<p>This is the definition I borrowed from a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub">GitHub Wikipedia article</a>. In short terms, it’s a place where every developer (or a student soon-to-be developer like me) can share their source code and their stories with the world. It’s a huge and highly respected collaboration platform.</p>

<p>It’s been used by every big technology company you can think of. Let me give you a few examples: <a href="https://github.com/google">Google</a>, <a href="https://github.com/twitter">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Github">Mozilla</a>, <a href="http://microsoft.github.io/">Microsoft</a>, <a href="https://code.facebook.com/projects/">Facebook</a>, <a href="http://adobe.github.io/">Adobe</a>, <a href="http://ibm.github.io/">IBM</a>, <a href="https://github.com/yahoo">Yahoo!</a>, <a href="https://github.com/linkedin">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="http://netflix.github.io/">Netflix</a>, <a href="https://github.com/dropbox">Dropbox</a> and <a href="https://github.com/paypal">PayPal</a>. Still think GitHub doesn’t have a huge support? What if I told you that <a href="https://github.com/WhiteHouse">White House</a> uses it too? I bet you didn’t know that some of these organizations even participate in the open source community at all!</p>

<p>So, why have they all chosen GitHub as a platform?</p>

<h2 id="a-great-place-to-store-your-code">A Great Place to Store Your Code</h2>

<p>Let’s be honest, today, if you’re not hosting your source code on GitHub, your open source project does not exist. I have a lot of respect for other solutions such as <a href="http://launchpad.net/">Launchpad</a> and <a href="https://bitbucket.org/">BitBucket</a>, but lets be honest, GitHub is the place to go if you need a place to share your source code.</p>

<h2 id="huge-developer-community">Huge Developer Community</h2>

<blockquote>There are 8.2M people collaborating right now across 19M repositories on GitHub. Developers from all around the world are building amazing things together. Their story is our story.</blockquote>

<p>I borrowed this quote from GitHub’s <a href="https://github.com/about">press page</a>. Over <em>eight million people</em> is not a small number, and they’ve all chosen GitHub as their choice. Together, they’ve created around 19 million repositories.</p>

<h2 id="github-as-a-replacement-for-linkedin">GitHub as a Replacement for LinkedIn</h2>

<p>Don’t get me wrong, I love LinkedIn and I’m using it myself for quite some time (you can find my LinkedIn profile <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/aleksandartodorovic">here</a>). But the truth is, you can post pretty much anything you want on LinkedIn and you can perfect your profile in any way you want. GitHub does not allow you to do the same.</p>

<h4 id="everything-you-publish-on-github-you-prove-it-right-away">Everything you publish on GitHub, you prove it right away.</h4>

<p>As an example, lets say that you posted on LinkedIn that you know how to program using C++. Your connections can endorse your skill and your employer can be sure that you know how to program using C++ if enough of your connections endorse it. But, if he visits your GitHub profile, he can see your C++ knowledge in action. He can read the code you’ve posted and based on the code, he can make sure that you’re a creative and a collaborative person, and that you have an experience in working with C++.</p>

<p>Now don’t get me wrong, your GitHub is not a replacement for your resume and you should not think of it as a replacement for your resume. <strong>But</strong>, it is a place where you can show your skills instead of talking about them. And there are some projects like <a href="https://osrc.dfm.io/">Open Source Report Card</a> that grabs your public GitHub data and represents them in a way that’s pretty similar to a resume (check out my Open Source Report Card <a href="https://osrc.dfm.io/aleksandar-todorovic/">here</a>).</p>

<h2 id="github-pages">GitHub Pages</h2>

<p>Now, let’s say that you want to build a website that represents you, your organization, your company, or anything else. You have a couple of options. You can buy your own domain and hosting service and build it from scratch. You can choose some freemium service like <a href="http://www.wix.com/">Wix</a>, where you will create a stunning website in minutes without any coding knowledge, but you will be limited to the features that service allows you to do.</p>

<p>So, lets say that you want to have a full control over your site, <em>without</em> any limitations what so ever, <em>and</em> you showcase your website development and design skills in the process, all of that <em>completely free of charge</em>. The solution? <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>! You can create your personal website, a website for your organization or a website for your project straight away. And it’s not really complicated to do that. Don’t believe me? Check out my <a href="http://aleksandar-todorovic.github.io/">online portfolio</a>! It took me less than 15 minutes to create it using a template offered by GitHub, and I have a full control of that website, which explains how I managed to alter the design of the template called Hack by <a href="https://github.com/bleikamp">Ben Bleikamp</a> (see how original template looks like <a href="http://sundaykofax.github.io/baby-legs/">here</a>).</p>

<h2 id="github-training">GitHub Training</h2>

<p>GitHub uses Git, which is a distributed revision control system designed and developed by Linus Torvalds for Linux kernel development back in 2005. It has become the most widely adopted version cotrol system for software development there is (<a href="https://ianskerrett.wordpress.com/2014/06/23/eclipse-community-survey-2014-results/">source</a>).</p>

<p>Now, lets say that you don’t know how to work with Git, the same way I didn’t know how how to work with Git not too long ago. Problem? Heck no! All resources for working with Git using GitHub as a platform are already provided for you by GitHub itself! GitHub offers you free resources (or training kits as they call them) <a href="https://training.github.com/kit/">here</a> and you also have a few free online courses available <a href="https://training.github.com/classes/">here</a>. Whatever learning option you choose to use out of those provided, you’ll see that your materials are divided in three difficulties: beginner/foundations, intermediate or advanced.</p>

<h2 id="github-gists">GitHub Gists</h2>

<p>This is the newest addition to the GitHub services. It’s a place where you’re able to share your text or a part of your code publicly (which means that your gist will be searchable by a search engine and viewed from your profile) or privately (which means that only people you choose are going to be able to view it, and you share Gists with them by simply copying a link).</p>

<h2 id="atom-text-editor">Atom Text Editor</h2>

<p>After I found out about <a href="https://atom.io/">Atom</a>, I fell in love with GitHub all over again. Atom is a hackable text editor for the 21st Century (as advertised by GitHub).</p>

<p>So, a hackable text editor, what does that even mean?</p>

<p>That means that you can hack every single thing inside of that text editor. Don’t know how? Not to worry, there are thousands of packages <a href="https://atom.io/packages">already available</a>, all of them hosted on GitHub and offered free of charge. Don’t like the design of the editor? Pick your favorite flavor of Atom out of thousands of them available <a href="https://atom.io/themes">here</a>. You can customize your installation to be anything from a simple text editor to a full IDE (short for Integrated Development Environment). Heck, you can even write your publications, your blog posts or your books in it. In fact, I even used it to write the post you’re currently reading (see the picture below) in the same way I’m using it to write every single post on <a href="https://aleksandartodorovic.wordpress.com/">my blog</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://aleksandartodorovic.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/screenshot-from-2015-01-25-024501.png"><img src="https://aleksandartodorovic.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/screenshot-from-2015-01-25-024501.png?w=300" alt="Picture of how I wrote this post" /></a></p>

<h2 id="github-student-developer-pack">GitHub Student Developer Pack</h2>

<p>This is something I recently discovered. A few days ago, I got a letter from my collage professor stating that as a student, I’m eligible to get a <a href="https://education.github.com/pack">GitHub Student Developer Pack</a>, which offers me over 15 free and paid development tools from GitHub and its partners at a huge discount. Now, I should point out that I’m still in the verification process at the time this article is published. This process could last for weeks! But, I should also point out that a guy called Alex Fernandez from GitHub staff has personally apologized to me for that. The reason why this process lasts for so long is because they have to review each request manually, which does take quite some time.</p>

<p><a href="https://aleksandartodorovic.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/github-mark-64px.png"><img src="https://aleksandartodorovic.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/github-mark-64px.png" alt="GitHub-Mark-64px" /></a></p>

<h2 id="github-has-an-amazing-support">GitHub Has an Amazing Support</h2>

<p>I’m a developer. I use a lot of stable and unstable software and services on a daily basis and it is important to me to get the support as fast as possible. I had an issue with a certain GitHub feature so I decided to contact <a href="https://github.com/contact">GitHub support</a>. I’ve got an email response in like 20 minutes, and they’ve been very helpful in the process. They’ve managed to explain to me why I had this issue and what I had to do to resolve it. I have to give them a straight 10/10 for their support.</p>

<h2 id="so-if-you-are-a-developer-is-there-a-reason-not-to-use-github">So, if you are a developer, is there a reason <em>not</em> to use GitHub?</h2>

<p>Honestly, I don’t think there is. If you’re developing a proprietary software, there are plenty of reasons why you should not post the source code of your application on GitHub. But, that should not stop you from working on open source software in your free time. By doing so, it will benefit you (once you start looking for a new job), it will benefit the developers behind a project that you’ve decided to be a part of, and it will benefit every single user of that open source project. GitHub offers you a wide variety of opportunities and you should take advantage of them!</p>
