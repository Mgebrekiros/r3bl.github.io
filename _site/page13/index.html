  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>I already wrote about my hacking beginnings <a href="https://aleksandartodorovic.wordpress.com/2014/07/12/flashback-my-first-cybersecurity-discovery/">here</a> and <a href="https://aleksandartodorovic.wordpress.com/2014/07/27/flashback-my-first-steps-in-hacking/">here</a>. Now, I want to talk about something else. I want to talk about how hacking changed my life!</p>

<p>Well, first of all, because I kept running into BackTrack tutorials while I was learning how to hack, I began to be interested in Linux and free software. I’ve spent days trying to install BackTrack in a virtual machine and connecting it with my network. I thought I just couldn’t configure my VM but, at the time, I didn’t know that I need to enter some command in terminal to unblock WiFi in BackTrack which was blocked for some reason whenever I booted into live CD or just installed BackTrack on my computer.</p>

<p>Anyway, I decided I’m tired of playing with VMs and for no obvious reason at all, I decided I should try to install it directly on my laptop. And I did manage to work it out! That was my first Linux distro I ever installed and it definitely wasn’t my last one (over the time I tried BackTrack, Linux Mint, Fedora, Arch Linux, elementary OS, Ubuntu, Kali Linux and wright now I’m running Kubuntu). Tinkering with free software is awesome and I contributed a lot to free software. So, hacking got me into free software.</p>

<p>In the beginning, I was really hooked up to Anonymous movement. I read this book called <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/We-Are-Anonymous-LulzSec-Insurgency/dp/0316213527">We Are Anonymous: Inside the Hacker World of LulzSec, Anonymous, and the Global Cyber Insurgency</a></em> and I was instantly hooked. So I started following Anonymous community in Facebook, YouTube, Twitter and I’ve seen numerous times that they posted pictures where they say reading is better than watching TV. They’ve kinda changed the way I look at the world. Following them was the reason I started reading books actively.</p>

<p>Because of hacking, I learned a lot about computers. I did spend my whole summer learning as much as I can but now I’m confident that I’m in the top twenty persons in my local community in knowledge about computers and networks.</p>

<p>Hacking woke up my thirst for knowledge, my thirst for books, and it kinda changed my view of the world through Anonymous. I’m not impressed with Anonymous as I used to be, but they did learn me a lot of things.</p>

<p>Hacking is awesome.</p>

<p>P.S. <a href="https://aleksandartodorovic.wordpress.com/2014/07/27/blogilo-wordpress-integration-is-terrible/">QTM is great</a>!</p>

    <p>First of all, sorry about the design of my previous post. I was trying Blogilo as a program for posting entries and the result was horrible! What I did is write down a post in LO Writer (need spelling while I write), copied it to Blogilo and clicked submit. The font was terrible, and I had to edit a post from a web interface because somewhere between my Blogilo and my blog some spaces just disappered!</p>

<p>Anyway, now I’m writing in QTM and I hope the post will be formated better before I write my next post in it.</p>

    <p>I was always a curious guy. I was always wondering how do some things work, but I just didn’t know how to find out about it. I, at the time, followed Discovery Channel, Viasat Explorer and other scientific shows because I wanted to know more. I would write down everything I thought it was fun to learn in my little notebook as a reference if I needed to learn more about that. I didn’t prepare for doing something like that. That’s why my notes were messy and Icouldn’t do anything about it. And of course, at the time, I did not have a computer or internet or smartphone or anything like that.</p>

<p>So,years later, I finally got internet connection! I was 16 years old back then. Yup, I lived 16 years without the internet and I can’t be happier about it. I had a nice childhood. Anyway, when I finally got an access to the internet, I did spend two years doing nothing and exploring the power of internet. I used Facebook a lot, used Skype, YouTube, and basically got an account in every social site ever. I was senior in high-school when I learned a thing or two about computers. I already mastered Pascal and Delphi, I knew some networking basics and I knew a lot about building my own desktop computer. But in my senior year, I was learning object-oriented programming. And while I was learning Visual Basic (6.0 was theversion my school decided to teach), I needed to do my final exam using Visual Basic, some basic printing app that will connect to MySQL database my friend was doing and print stuff from it on a specifically designed pieces of paper.</p>

<p>I didn’t want to do it Visual Basic 6.0. That version was sooo old! And I needed some support looking things up on the internet! So I decided I should download Visual Studio 2012. And I did. And I learned programming in Visual Basic that’s four or five versions more advanced than the version they taught us in school. I felt so proud!</p>

<p>In the end, I didn’t manage to finish the whole final exam. The app was full of bugs and I didn’t like it. While I was presenting my final work to a couple my teachers I managed to socially engineer them (at the time, I had no idea what social engineering is exactly, but stillmanaged to pull it off) and I got the highest grade <em>without everactually running my program</em>! Damn that felt so good.</p>

<p>After that, my high-school was finished and I had some spare months until my collage begins. I started being curious. I wanted to know what that <em>s _represents in _https</em>. So I started learning, and learning. I did DDoS a couple of websites, did some automated SQL injection using Havij accessed some admin panels using passwords I extracted using Havij and that was pretty much the whole scope of my hacking back then.</p>

    <p>I know that this post is going to be pretty basic, but it was not very detailed in my head so I wanted to write about it to remember it easier.</p>

<p>So, what tools and techniques can someone use to gather information about a certain person or company?</p>

<p>Well, your best friend is Google + Evernote combination. Basically, what you <em>can</em> do is to write down all of the data you think it will be usable in Evernote. Next, look up that company using social sites such as Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn etc. now, why is that important? Well, it is important because maybe their employees listed that company as their job on their social sites. From there, you can find out a lot about who is working there. Write it down in Evernote and proceed.</p>

<p>Next stop is finding out what their workers do the best. So you’ll use maybe a little social engineering to get to information their employees are posting on their social media. By looking at their resumes, their likes and their tweets, you can find out a lot about a certain person. After you do that, you just match them up to see where do their interests combine.</p>

<p>For an example, if a couple of their employees listed Java as their field of expertize on their LinkedIn profile, there’s a big chance that their site or applications they provide will include some parts of Java code. Your job is to find more that clues and to paint as precise picture of a company as possible.</p>

<p>Does not seem that hard, does it?</p>
