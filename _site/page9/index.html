  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>This is something that’s bothering me in the last 20 minutes I guess. Does really everyone think of it just as an alternative to Chrome? To be honest, Chrome is winning the browser market, Apple and Microsoft are trying to stop that, but only with one goal: replacing Chrome with their own solutions. Is there anyone who thinks that a small non-profit organization like Mozilla can do to mess that up?</p>

<p>Let’s step up a little. Let’s talk about operating systems. Microsoft has Windows and controls pretty much all of the desktops out there. Apple has his own Mac products. Google has most of the mobile users and Chrome OS. While Mozilla does not have anything besides Firefox OS.</p>

<p>Don’t get me wrong, I love Mozilla and would buy a phone with Firefox OS as soon as it becomes available in my country. But, loving Mozilla as an organization is actually pretty much any reason why someone would buy Firefox OS phone in the first place.</p>

<p>Now, if you use the Internet (which of course you do, otherwise you won’t be reading this blog post) there’s like a 99,9% chance that you’re using one or more of the Google products. Google Search, YouTube, GMail, Blogger or something else. Now the problem is, if you don’t use Chrome, you have to live with some limitations while using Google’s services on the web.</p>

<p>Let me give you an example. My roommate played some songs a couple of months ago using YouTube as a platform. Suddenly, he started speeding up and slowing down the playback of those songs. I was curious, how does he do that? But I didn’t say a word, I thought he downloaded those songs and messed around with their speed using his audio player. It went on for days and I realized that he’s changing songs far more quickly than he could downloaded them and played. So I took a glimpse at his laptop and saw that he’s not using anything besides his browser to do so. And, his browser, of course, was Google Chrome. Then I thought he’s using some extension that allows him to do so. So I finally got enough courage to ask him how does he do that? He said he’s not using anything besides Google Chrome. I could not believe it so I installed Chrome and I realized that he’s telling the truth. Playback speed options were there once I opened a YouTube video with Chrome. I could not believe it.</p>

<p>So Google messed around with YouTube and I could probably remake this option just by switching my user agent in Firefox, but that was not the end. Soon I found out Google has some limitations on using Google’s Docs and other services. So Google is kind of forcing you to use Chrome to use those specific features.</p>

<p>What if Google steps up a little and starts implementing some other features specifically for Chrome? He’s going to force people to use Chrome to access those specific features.</p>

<p>How can Mozilla compete with that when Google practically controls the Internet and we’re all using their products? It can’t.</p>

<p>There is no way for someone to stop using Google’s services. I did try to do that. So I switched to Firefox from Chrome, I used mail.ru as my email provider, I started using DuckDuckGo as my primary search engine, but that’s as far as I could go. I can’t stop using YouTube and DuckDuckGo because even though DuckDuckGo is great, it can’t provide the perfect results to my searches so I occasionally have to enter !g bang in my search bar.</p>

<p>So, we’re stuck in a wormhole. We have to use Google’s services and by doing that, we have to be ready to accept the fact that there are certain features we’re missing. And we can’t stop using Google’s services completely and enjoy browsing the Internet. It’s just not possible.</p>

<p>So, what I’m asking everyone to do, on the Internet <em>and</em> in real life, <a href="http://robert.ocallahan.org/2014/08/choose-firefox-now-or-later-you-wont.html">start using Firefox while you still have a choice</a>! It looks to me like sooner or later we’re not going to have an alternative. And that really bums me out as a huge Firefox and Thunderbird fan.</p>

    <p>Listajući početnu na Tviteru naletio sam na nešto zanimljivo. Nepoznati haker koji se krije iza aliasa Phineas Fisher je 6. augusta hakovao stranicu koja stoji iza programa FinFisher. Taj program jeste dosta nepoznat za javnost, ali ne bi trebao da bude. Program je razvijen u Njemačkoj sa ciljem da se prodaje vladama različitih zemalja kako bi špijunirali one koje odluče da žele da špijuniraju. Haker je zatim objavio <a href="https://netzpolitik.org/wp-upload/finfisher.torrent">torrent</a> od 40ak gigabajta sa podacima koje je uspio da ukrade.</p>

<p>E sada, podaci su ukrani, kompanija Gamma koja stoji iza programa je odbila da komentariše da je neko provalio u njihov sistem, a baza je postala dostupna u javnosti. Sada je na redu onaj manje zabavan dio: analiziranje svih tih podataka. Zanima me da li će iko od domaćih medija biti spreman za to. Ja jesam, zato trenutno preuzimam torrent od svih 40ak gigabajta.</p>

<p>Međutim, ono što me navelo da se zapravo uputim u ovu pustolovinu jeste to što se među podacima koje su do sada analizirali neki od osoba koji su preuzeli torrent našle različite države kao naručioci ovog proizvoda. Osobe koje analiziraju te podatke su došle do imena država preko Gamminog sistema za podršku tako što su obraćali pažnju na osobe koje su jednostavno otkrile državu koju predstavljaju ne prateći pravila za anonimnost na internetu (tipa koristeći mejl sa .ba domenom ili slično). A, ono najzanimljivije za nas jeste što se među tim državama našla i Bosna i Hercegovina!</p>

<p>Ko li špijunira iz našeg državnog vrha i koga to tačno? Ostaje nam da vidimo. Meni fali još nekih dan i 13 sati da preuzmem sve podatke (limitovao sam brzinu da ne ograničim previše korišćenje interneta drugim ukućanima) pa se bacam na analiziranje. Svakako ću sve što otkrijem objaviti na ovom blogu i na svom <a href="https://twitter.com/r3bl_">Tviter nalogu</a>, pa pratite ako vas zanima.</p>

<p>Međutim, ono što me trenutno zanima više od same vijesti jeste to koliko će daleko dogurati vijest u našoj javnosti? Da li će se bilo koji portal ili medijska kuća uopšte obazirati na ovo? Da li će pokriti priču? Da li će iko osim mene pokušati da sazna koji se kurac zapravo događa i to pokušati da podijeli sa javnošću?</p>

<p>Ostaje nam samo da čekamo i saznamo.</p>

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>So, in the last 48 hours I was again, looking for a new distro. Don’t know why, but I just felt I should be using something else.</p>

<p>And again, I was search for the perfect distro for my needs. As you know if you’re following my blog, I’m a big security researcher kind a guy. So, naturally, my first choice was Kali Linux. But, the problem is that I don’t like GNOME interface. Don’t know why, but it’s just not right for me. So, I tried compiling my own Kali Linux .iso file with KDE interface. Well, it’s easy to say that that didn’t work as planned. I did not manage to get it working. So I tried installing regular Kali Linux and replacing GNOME interface with KDE. That also didn not work as planned.</p>

<p>I felt kinda noobish. Even though I’ve tried a lot of distros and even though I did install Kali Linux before as my main operating system, I just could not get it to work perfectly with my Windows 8.1 and a TrueCrypt-encrypted shared partition. So I decided I should use some other KDE-based distro and fill it up with security software. I installed openSUSE but I just could not get their password manager. So I decided I should stick with Kubuntu because I wanted that apt-get so badly! It took me at least three or four clean installs to get it to work right. I kept changing my repo server that messed things up. Once I even stopped the upgrade command in progress and that messed things up for me.</p>

<p>But, finally, I managed to get it to work. And it feels great and robust just as I hoped it will. So, I’m back with Kubuntu, I really like the job the Kubuntu developers are doing and I’m also considering about joining the community and participating in Kubuntu development. But first, a couple of days of trying it out, just to make sure I don’t mess anything up. Again.</p>

    <p>If you’re like me, the chances are you like learning new things. If you’re like me, than you love computer science. I have a big passion to learn as much as I can about computers. Because it’s kind of a huge subject and no human could ever learn everything about computers, I had to decide which subject I should focus on. The choice was not that hard for me and I’ve decided relatively easy that my subject of choice is cyber security. I care about privacy and man do I love breaking things!</p>

<p>So, what I want to represent today is a git. Inside that git, you’ll find a lot of computer science related academic papers uploaded my people like you and me. The point of doing this git is to create a high quality source for papers, and those 50 contributors are doing the hell of a job doing that. It’s the little projects like this that makes me happy. When people unite and do something awesome together. I’m even happier because this is the first use of git I found useful that is not related to any programming language.</p>

<p>So, if you do have some spare time, some research papers stored on your local drive and a wish to give back to the community, I will ask you to visit <a href="https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love">Papers We Love repository</a>, fork it and upload the shit out of good quality papers to it! I know I will. Especially because I saw that the security section is pretty empty for now.</p>

  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>There’s something I need to confess. Even though I’m a hardcore Linux and free software advocate, I have to say that Microsoft, as a company, is not so bad. So, why am I saying this?</p>

<p>I’ve never paid a single euro for any Microsoft product. I was running cracked software like 95% of people in my country. Now this is not a secret at all. My father runs a small company (around 10 of employees) and I was doing some research about how licensing works in my country. I was amazed. As it turns out, the companies <em>are</em> required to have licensed software, <em>but</em>, if the inspection comes, they will look at a specific list of software and they’ll ask you if you have a license for those programs. What I’m trying to say is that a company only needs to have legal operating system, legal office suite and that’s about it. Add some Adobe products if you use them inside of your company and you’re good to go! Now, the situation gets even worse when we focus on personal users. No-one will <em>ever</em> ask you for a license. It’s like this word doesn’t even exist in my country.</p>

<p>Anyway, back to the story. So, I was running cracked Windows software until a year and a half. Then I found out about the world of Linux and I’ve never looked back. But, being a student and using nothing but open source technology is <em>really</em> hard in a country like mine (and practically anywhere else in the world!). So, my first year began and they required more and more of proprietary software for us to have. Most of them are developed by Microsoft. But, we also got a DreamSpark account, so most of the software they required from us were free of charge. That’s how I got my Microsoft Visio, Microsoft Visual Studio and stuff like that, all for nothing. After that, number of unlicensed programs I had from Microsoft was down to two.</p>

<p>As I’ve said earlier in the story, my father is running a small company. After catastrophical floods that hit south-east part of Europe in this year, my father had to start his job all over. So what he did is he bought a new laptop for himself and he needed to buy Microsoft’s Office license. All they had in as store we looked up was a single license for Office 365 Home Plus. He decided to take it. What I’ve found out after that is that this license can be used by <em>five email addresses</em> legally. He used the first one for his laptop, and I used the second for mine. Also got some extra space in OneDrive and some free premium Skype minutes. And now, I’m down to one, and it’s the main one: Microsoft’s Windows 8.1. Not sure how I will get the license for it, but I’m sure I somehow will. The license costs somewhere around 100 euros, which is about the same as the amount of money I spend on food, cigarettes and going out in a month.</p>

<p>Today, while I was downloading Microsoft Visio from my DreamSpark account, I found out something else. I found out that I have a free license for Windows Store in my DreamSpark account. Oh, and also, I got an access to Microsoft Virtual Academy with _a lot _of courses and I got some books for free as well.</p>

<p>So, to summarize things up, I got a lot of software from Microsoft and I didn’t actually pay anything to use it. I got only a couple of software products without a license for now but I’m working on replacing them with something legal. And I’m still trying to find my Linux alternative to <a href="http://elementaryos.org/">elementary OS</a>. While waiting for <a href="http://isfreyareleasedyet.com/">Freya</a>, I’m spending most of my time in Windows looking for some alternative I will use until Freya is released. No luck for now.</p>

<p>I trust Microsoft a lot more than I trust Google.</p>
