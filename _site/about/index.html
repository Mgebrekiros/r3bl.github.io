      <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> As of June 18th (2015), this page contains more personalized version of the story of my life. If you want to see what I had actually done as an open source advocate, check out <a href="https://aleksandar-todorovic.github.io/en/portfolio">my portfolio</a>. Alternatively, you can also see the short version of my portfolio by downloading my resume (available in both <a href="https://aleksandar-todorovic.github.io/assets/portfolio-en.pdf">English</a>
and <a href="https://aleksandar-todorovic.github.io/assets/portfolio-bs.pdf">Bosnian</a> language).</p>

<h2 id="short-version">Short version</h2>

<p>I’m <a href="http://r3bl.github.io/en/open-source-advocacy">an Open Source Advocate</a> with a huge passion for Artificial Intelligence and Cyber Security. I’m a Community Moderator at <a href="http://r3bl.github.io/en/open-source-advocacy">Opensource.com</a>. I love contributing to open source projects, mostly <a href="http://opensource.com/business/14/12/8-ways-contribute-open-source-without-writing-code">without writing code</a>. I’ve contributed to a couple of worldy-known open source projects such as <a href="https://reddit.com/">reddit</a>, <a href="https://elementary.io/">elementary OS</a>, and the <a href="https://www.torproject.org">Tor Project</a>. I’m writing content in both English and Bosnian language. So far (aside from this blog of course) I’ve written content for <a href="http://opensource.com/">Opensource.com</a>, <a href="http://kompjuteras.com/">Kompjuteraš</a> and <a href="https://libre.lugons.org/">LiBRE! magazine</a>.</p>

<h2 id="long-version">Long version</h2>

<p>I like writing. I started writing back in 2013 when I started contributing to <a href="https://libre.lugons.org/">LiBRE! magazine</a> (regional digital free software magazine written in Serbian language). Then, in July 2014, I started my blog. My blog was previously hosted <a href="http://aleksandartodorovic.wordpress.com/">on Wordpress.com domain</a> before I decided to migrate it to GitHub Pages + Jekyll combination back in January (2015). In June (2015), I took my writing skills to a whole new level by joining <a href="http://opensource.com">Opensource.com</a> as their new Community Moderator. You can read my announcement and my initial impressions <a href="https://r3bl.github.io/en/partnership-with-opensource-dot-com/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Apart from writing, I live an open source life. I’m using open source technologies every day and I contribute to open source software as much as I can (which is <em>at least</em> once a week). I don’t really consider myself as a programmer because I didn’t write any code worthy of mentioning so far, but I am working on it!</p>

<p>Even though I didn’t write any useful code so far, that didn’t stop me from contributing to open source software. I started back in 2013 by joining the reddit’s translation team to help them to translate their service to Serbian language.</p>

<p>I speak three languages on a native level: Bosnian, Serbian and Croatian. And no, I’m not a <em>big</em> fan of learning new languages. Those three languages are pretty much the same (with <em>very</em> small differences), we just call them differently because of the political reasons. I posses dual citizenship from Serbia and Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina. I’m also speaking English on a professional level (or at least I hope so) and I know a bit of German and Dutch as well.</p>

<p>I like reading books. I like watching Science Fiction movies. I’m even trying to write a book in my free time, but judging by the way I started, I’m not sure will I ever finish it.</p>

<p>My journey in the Linux world began two years ago (yes, 2013 was a life-changing year for me). I started learning about Cyber Security (or whatever you want to call this field) and soon enough I started experimenting with different Linux distros. I started with Kali Linux before I went to Fedora and later on to Linux Mint. Then, I switched to openSUSE for a while. Later on I switched to Arch Linux, which I used for a couple of months before I (finally) switched to my beloved <a href="https://elementaryio">elementary OS</a>. My Linux journey was a painstaking process in the beginning full of ups and downs. But I remained stubborn and once I switched to elementary OS I never looked back.</p>

<p>Even though I’m a Linux user, I’m not anti-Microsoft. I’m paying for a lot of their services. I have (a legal version of) Windows 8.1 laying around my hard drive (although I’m not really using it), I have a subscription to Microsoft’s Office 365, I have a DreamSpark account and I have more than 1TB of space on OneDrive. I’m not using Linux because it’s free as in beer, I’m using Linux because it’s free as in speech.</p>

<p>I’m not really a smartphone user and I don’t own a tablet. Sorry smartphones, but until something affordable and truly open (like Firefox OS or Ubuntu Mobile) becomes available in my country, I’m not throwing away my “dumbphone”. The only piece of sophisticated tech equipment I have is my laptop. I’m using <a href="https://www.asus.com/Notebooks_Ultrabooks/X54HR/">ASUS X54HR</a> with the best configuration available (Intel’s i3 processor, AMD Radeon HD 7470M and 4GB of RAM). I’m not very satisfied with it, but I got used to its flaws and I’ve been using it for three years now. My keyboard is broken so I’m using the cheapest and smallest external keyboard that I could find (<a href="http://www.lingua-centar.hr/cybershop/slike/0160566_big.jpg">this one</a>), I have a couple of stuck pixels on my monitor and the plastic snapped in more than one place, but my laptop is still in one piece (for now). This is the first laptop my family has bought, it went through a lot with me and it was there throughout my whole Linux journey, which is why I don’t even consider switching to something new (at least until I screw it up even further), although I have an <a href="http://www.notebookcheck.net/Review-Acer-Aspire-E1-571G-Notebook.88806.0.html">Acer Aspire E1-571G</a> which is now primarily used by my brother. Both of these laptops are considered as affordable (around €500). If you want to buy one, I suggest you to buy Acer instead of ASUS out of those two models I have a lot of experience with.</p>

<p>While I was in my teenager years, DJ-ing was my primary hobby. I had just recently decided to give up on my dream of becoming a worldly-known DJ (you can read why I decided to quit DJ-ing <a href="https://r3bl.github.io/en/quitting-djing/">here</a>). I also did some amateur music production using pirated versions of the software, but don’t judge me, most of the electronic music producers are using pirated version (famous ones as well). That software is just too damn expensive (I’m talking about tens of thousands of Dollars / Euros). Although I gave up on pursing my dream of making it in this world, I still like electronic dance music more than any other genre of music. I still go to parties to listen to other DJs playing whenever I can.</p>

<p>My biggest role model is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz">Aaron Swartz</a>. He truly was a genius of our time and I really like the way he thought. I do realize that he did some activities that are standing on the edge of what is considered as legal, but I strongly believe that he wasn’t guilty. If he haven’t committed suicide (which is his act which I, of course, don’t support in any way), I believe that he would’ve proven his innocence in court. It’s really a shame we lost such a great mind.</p>

<p>I’m not really an emotional person. I rarely take things emotionally. I like to get what I want from people and to give those people what they want, but I don’t usually get too attached to them. I lived in three different cities over my life. I didn’t really stay in contact with anyone from the previous cities I lived in. I started from scratch each time and adjusted myself to the new surrounding (and I will do the same as soon as I get a new opportunity). I don’t have a best friend for life. I have a couple of good friends that are supporting me, but we’re not really attached in a way that we can’t continue our lives once our lives start to go in different directions. I’m not going to allow anyone to slow me down on my way of doing something which will benefit me any time soon.</p>

<p>I like giving back to my local community by participating in various volunteering opportunities. I even had the opportunity to spent a month in the Netherlands volunteering to their local community (in two cities: Rijswijk and Amsterdam) which was a life-changing experience to me. If you want to find out more about that, read <a href="http://r3bl.github.io/en/evs-netherlands-experience/">this blog post</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.redhat.com/">Red Hat</a> is my dream company. I like what they’re doing and I like the principles they’re using. I have nothing but positive experience with working with people from Red Hat through my volunteership with the Opensource.com brand which is sponsored by them.</p>

<p>I care about my privacy. I’m limiting my use of products from companies connected to the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/06/us-tech-giants-nsa-data">PRISM program</a>. I’m using <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">DuckDuckGo</a> as my search engine of choice (and I love it). I’m using Russian email service because I know that they have much smaller influence on my overall Internet experience than more popular solutions like GMail, Outlook and similar services. I’m using Mozilla’s products (<a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/">Firefox</a> and <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/">Thunderbird</a>) to explore the web and manage all of my email addresses (and I highly recommend those two products to everyone).</p>

<p>I’m a regular <a href="https://twitter.com/r3bl_">Twitter user</a>, <a href="https://github.com/aleksandar-todorovic/">GitHub user</a>, <a href="https://www.careerdean.com/u/aleksandar-todorovi">CareerDean user</a> and <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/">Goodreads user</a>. I occasionally use <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/aleksandartodorovic">LinkedIn</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/aleksandar.todorovic.r3bl">Facebook</a>. Yes, unlike most of my generation, I don’t spend most of my days on Facebook, Viber, WhatsApp or whatever. I’m doing my best to be as productive as I can, but there’s still a lot of things I can do to improve my daily workflow.</p>
