        Is It Time For The Pirate Bay to Disappear For Good?

    <time datetime="2014-12-14T18:54:27+01:00" class="post-date">14 Dec 2014</time>

    <p><a href="https://aleksandartodorovic.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/selection_002.png"><img src="https://aleksandartodorovic.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/selection_002.png" alt="Selection_002" /></a></p>

<p>So, a few days ago, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pirate_Bay">The Pirate Bay</a> was raided. The site itself is still not online and we have no indications whether or not it <em>will</em> come back online. There’s a lot of fake sites that advertise themselves as The Pirate Bay, but are basically of no use (users can’t upload new torrents, the database of torrents is either too old or don’t work at all).</p>

<p>I myself can’t figure out do I want The Pirate Bay to stay down or to come back online. So, why am I saying that?</p>

<p>Well, first of all, the fact is that The Pirate Bay had a huge influence in making the world what it is today (I will probably cover that topic in some future blog post). But, lets be honest, the design of the website is way too old, the code behind the website is pretty outdated too, and there’s nothing new going on on the site itself for quite some time.</p>

<p>If we look at those flaws, we can basically say that the site itself got ran over by time. But don’t get me wrong, The Pirate Bay itself did an excellent job at what it was supposed to do. It had the biggest torrent collection available on the Internet, it had the biggest reputation amongst all other peer-to-peer (P2P) services, and it is one of the top 100 visited websites at the moment (<a href="http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/thepiratebay.se">according to Alexa</a>).</p>

<p>So, maybe it’s time for something new? <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Sunde">Peter Sunde</a>, co-founder and ex-spokesperson of The Pirate Bay definitely <a href="http://blog.brokep.com/2014/12/09/the-pirate-bay-down-forever/">agrees with me</a> on that.</p>

<blockquote>**Peter Sunde:** It feels good that it might have closed down forever, just a real shame the way it did that. A planned retirement would have given the community time and a way to kick off something new, something better, something faster, something more reliable and with no chance of corrupting itself. Something that had a soul and could retain it.</blockquote>

<p>Is the <a href="http://oldpiratebay.org/">Old Pirate Bay</a> exactly what we’re looking for? Old Pirate Bay is a search engine provided by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IsoHunt">Iso</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IsoHunt">hunt</a>, one of the biggest competitors to The Pirate Bay.</p>

<p>The design of the site feels like it’s an upgraded version of The Pirate Bay. The site works perfectly and the workflow of the site is pretty much the same as in The Pirate Bay.</p>

<p>I have to agree with Peter, it is time for The Pirate Bay to shutdown completely, and it is the time for the community to think of something new and original to revolutionize the way we share files. The Pirate Bay did it job perfectly for over a decade and now seems like a perfect time for it do disappear from the Internet. In the meantime, Old Pirate Bay seems like a pretty decent alternative.</p>
