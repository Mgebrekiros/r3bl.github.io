    <p>Today I found out about a great note-taking web-app called <a href="https://github.com/Laverna/laverna">Laverna</a>. It’s an open source program that you can just download on your PC and run through your browser*. It has a built-in AES encryption so you can store confidential data in it. All your data will be encrypted using you password. It also supports saving your database in the cloud (via Dropbox or via SecureStorage with more cloud services to be implemented soon).</p>

<p>I need to say that even though its list of features is pretty amazing, the web-app has a lot of bugs. If you encounter some of them, I highly suggest that you report them <a href="https://github.com/Laverna/laverna/issues">here</a>.</p>

<p>This seems like a fun and simple project. I’m probably going to write about Evernote and OneNote open source alternatives in a new edition of <a href="http://libre.lugons.org/">LiBRE! Magazine</a> so be sure to keep an eye on our site if you speak Serbian/Bosnian/Croatian language.</p>

  <li>I noticed that the application does not support Internet Explorer 11.</li>

    <p>So, I started my college education last October. First semester I wasn’t very good. I passed tree of five subjects I was supposed to pass and I got pretty much amazing grades in the subjects I did pass. But now, during the second semester, I started learning for my Cisco CCNA certificate. That certificate was the reason I decided to go on this collage (although, to be honest, my choice was very limited considering my financial situation at the time).</p>

<p>Now, I came to the end of the second semester. In my R&amp;S course (first course in the path to CCNA certificate), I wasn’t very active. I didn’t go to all of the classes in that course I wasn’t very regular in lab exercises. I did not study every week and I had more and more materials to learn. I knew that, but I just didn’t pay attention. I took collage for granted and now I have a problem.</p>

<p>Tomorrow is my final test in my R&amp;S course and I’m stuck. I did <em>try</em> to study for it as much as I could in the last ten days. I managed to learn first eight chapters, but I got stuck during the chapter nine. I just can’t understand subnetting and it’s just a big pain in the butt for me. I lost my concentration and now I have no idea what to do. I studied that chapter yesterday. I’ve spent pretty much all of my day studying it and I still couldn’t finish a basic subnetting in Packet Tracer. Now, I’m trying to do the same, but I just cannot concentrate at all. And, I still have two more chapter to go through after I finish this one.</p>

<p>Passing this exam is not going to be easy at all, but I will give my best. After all, being a cybersecurity specialist is my dream for a couple of years, and I just can’t be that if I don’t understand how networks actually work. This is going to be a long night.</p>

    <p>So, when I was 12 years old (at least I think I was) I didn’t have a functioning computer. My father contacted one of my neighbor and he had a spare laptop he didn’t use for a long time. He gave it to my family and I finally had something to amuse me.</p>

<p>The year was 2006. I was living in a small village located in northern Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina, 40 kilometers away from the nearest town. Not an ideal place to live, I know. Having an internet in a place like that in that age was a privilege that not a lot of people could afford.</p>

<p>So, I had a laptop that was previously used, no internet connection and not a lot of games. The laptop had Windows 98 installed. Unlike my family, that neighbor that gave us that laptop had an internet access. So, I started tinkering with it to see what’s in there. I accessed system folder in that thing and after a few days I noticed a directory that sounded fun: Temporary Internet Files. That sounded like fun. I had no idea what was stored in there but I wanted to find out. So I opened a directory. It had numerous amount of subdirectories and some picture files. Hm, I wonder what kind of images were there. And then, I made my first cybersecurity discovery.</p>

<p>That directory was packed with porn pictures. Literally hundreds of them. I haven’t used such an old Windows system since then, but I guess my neighbor used Internet Explorer and I guess that Internet Explorer kept all of temporary pictures inside that folder back then.</p>

<p>At the time, I was really into command prompt. I didn’t know what it does and I didn’t know any commands on it, but I wanted to find out how to use it. So I started typing some random commands and once I typed in: help. That command gave me a list of all available cmd commands so I started to tinker with my laptop. I managed to do some basic changes to the system using cmd. I changed the time and date of the system and I couldn’t be more proud of me than I was back then.</p>

<p>So, to combine these two stories. I knew about that Temporary Internet Files folder and I didn’t know pretty much anything about cmd and what it does. I remember once I opened up my cmd, pressed Ctrl+Enter (keyboard shortcut that opened cmd in full screen back then). So I started typing this long text as a command. That text included my opinion about that neighbor after I discovered that directory. Yeah, you could only imagine what a 12 year old boy would think about some friend of his father after he discovered that. So I typed it and at the end I wrote a sentence that basically said: If you ever read this, stay away from John Doe! And I pressed enter. The command did nothing of course, it was just some plain text written in my native language. I know, what a dumb thing to do.</p>

<p>So, I never looked at that neighbor the same after that of course. I felt like a detective that found out something valuable. I remember coming to their house one day with my family, playing with his daughters, and looking for a chance to somehow get in his bedroom unnoticed so I could find out more. Yeah, I thought he was a freaking child molester or something. In the end, I didn’t get the chance to get to his bedroom unnoticed, so I gave up.</p>

<p>After that, that laptop got some hardware problems and it eventually stopped working. My detective story has ended there. But, six or seven years later, I started studying more about computer networks so I could protect people like my poor neighbor who just wanted to watch some porn videos unnoticed. And so, my journey into cybersecurity field has begun.</p>
