        Best (Linux) Programs and Services I've Started Using in 2014.
      </a>
    </h1>

    <time datetime="2015-01-10T18:19:41+01:00" class="post-date">10 Jan 2015</time>

    <p>In this post, I’m going to share with you a couple of programs / web services / apps that I’ve started using regularly in 2014. I’ve discovered some of them in 2013, but in 2014 I really started to use them on a regular basis. I hope that you will find something for yourself in my list.</p>

<h3 id="best-operating-system-elementary-os-freyahttpelementaryosorg">Best operating system: <a href="http://elementaryos.org/">elementary OS Freya</a></h3>

<p>I’ve been using elementary OS since 2013. But it definitely became my primary operating system in 2014. I haven’t used Windows in months now and I’m not missing anything. Plus, It’s a real joy participating in the development since the release of Beta 1 version. I’m also <a href="https://aleksandartodorovic.wordpress.com/2014/11/11/elementary-os-bosnian-language/">translating elementary OS to Bosnian language</a> in my free time. Too bad I haven’t finished my job by the end of 2014, but I think that the translation is pretty much usable by now.</p>

<h3 id="best-text-editor-atomhttpsatomio">Best text editor: <a href="https://atom.io/">Atom</a></h3>

<p>This is a hackable text editor for the 21st century, as advertised by worldly-known <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>. I’ve been using it for a couple of months and loving every single aspect of it. In fact, I’m writing this and every single other article in it using Markdown as a styling language before posting them to Wordpress.</p>

<h3 id="best-productivity-apps-todotxthttptodotxtcom-gitithttpgititnet-and-rescuetimehttprescuetimecom">Best productivity apps: <a href="http://todotxt.com/">Todo.txt</a>, <a href="http://gitit.net/">Gitit</a> and <a href="http://rescuetime.com/">RescueTime</a></h3>

<p>I’ve been using <a href="http://evernote.com/">Evernote</a> for a couple of months, but the clunky interface of the desktop version for Windows and the fact that there is no official Linux client really started to annoy me big time.</p>

<p>So I’ve started looking for the alternatives and Todo.txt in a combination with Gitit looks like a perfect alternative to me. So, what I’ve started doing is writing my notes inside a wiki that I’m running on my local machine (using Gitit as a platform).</p>

<p>I’m using Todo.txt as my to-do list natively in Linux using <a href="https://github.com/mNantern/QTodoTxt">QTodoTxt</a> and so far it works great! Been using it for a couple of months now and I see no reason why I won’t be using it throughout 2015.</p>

<p>RescueTime is not really a productivity app. It’s more of a way to see how productive you are really. With the native application running in the background, I can see how much of my time has been spent doing something productive. Native Linux client and Firefox add-on are a perfect combination for me.</p>

<h3 id="best-tools-for-communication-pidginhttppidginim-my-bloghttpsaleksandartodorovicwordpresscom-and-twitterhttpstwittercomr3bl">Best tools for communication: <a href="http://pidgin.im/">Pidgin</a>, <a href="https://aleksandartodorovic.wordpress.com/">my blog</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/r3bl_">Twitter</a></h3>

<p>I’m really loving the way Pidgin is integrated in my operating system. I’ve been using it since 2013, but now I’m using it exclusively to chat with my Facebook friends. In fact, I’m opening Facebook no more than once a day now, which means that most of my time is spent doing something a little bit more productive.</p>

<p>I really found myself in the management of this blog. I’m enjoying every second of writing stuff for my audience and I’m pretty satisfied with the <a href="https://aleksandartodorovic.wordpress.com/2015/01/01/blog-stats-2014/">support I’m getting from you guys</a>.</p>

<p>Twitter has been my primary social network since the end of the 2013. But, in 2014, I’ve started running two Twitter profiles, one personal, and one for my business communications. I’ve managed to bond with some awesome people and learn a lot by reading articles other people are suggesting to me through their Twitter feed.</p>

<h3 id="best-cloud-service-megahttpsmegaconz">Best cloud service: <a href="https://mega.co.nz/">MEGA</a></h3>

<p>Although I have 1 TB of space on <a href="http://onedrive.live.com/">OneDrive</a> and one more TB of space in <a href="https://cloud.mail.ru/">Mail.Ru Cloud</a>, I have to select MEGA as my favourite for 2014. Unlike Mail.Ru Cloud and OneDrive it has a perfectly integrated Linux client and 50 GB of space is enough to satisfy my needs for now, although I’m planning to switch to some premium plan in the near future.</p>

<h3 id="best-reading-services-kindlehttpsreadamazoncom-and-digghttpdiggcom">Best reading services: <a href="https://read.amazon.com/">Kindle</a> and <a href="http://digg.com/">Digg</a></h3>

<p>It’s been a while since I’ve discovered Kindle ebook readers. I’m still thinking about whether should I buy one or not. In the meantime, I’m really enjoying reading books through the online interface of the Kindle reader. I have over 150 books in my library now thanks to the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/freeebooks">Free eBooks subreddit</a> and a simple <a href="https://ifttt.com/myrecipes/personal/17091741">IFTTT recipe</a> which sends me the daily digest of new posts. I haven’t payed a dime for any of the books in it and I have books that are probably worth more than $1,000 dollars by now.</p>

<p>Digg is the perfect way for me to stay in touch with the latest news from my favourite blogs (such as those in my blogroll in the sidebar).</p>

<h3 id="best-multimedia-services-popcorn-timehttppopcorntimeio-spotifyhttpswwwspotifycomus-and-clementinehttpswwwclementine-playerorg">Best multimedia services: <a href="http://popcorntime.io/">Popcorn Time</a>, <a href="https://www.spotify.com/us/">Spotify</a> and <a href="https://www.clementine-player.org/">Clementine</a></h3>

<p>Even though I’m not a huge fan of pirating (I’m all about open source software and creative commons), the fact <em>is</em> that I live in a country where most of the movies and TV shows are not available. Popcorn Time really helps me to be in touch with my favourite TV shows and I’m loving the simplicity and the design of the application itself.</p>

<p>I’m from Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina, a country with <em>no</em> music streaming service <em>at all</em>. That’s why I’ve had to wake the hacker inside of me and found a solution to run Spotify as my choice. Basically, I’m using <a href="http://www.vpnbook.com/freevpn">OpenVPN</a> once every 15 days to log into my Spotify account and then I enter a “vacation mode”, which enables me to run Spotify for the next 15 days. And Spotify does have a <a href="https://www.spotify.com/int/download/other/">Spotify for Linux Preview</a> client which, although a bit unstable, does the job perfectly for me so far.</p>

<p>And now, why am I including Clementine in this list? Well, it’s because of the Internet streaming option. I’m a big <a href="http://www.di.fm/">Digitally Imported</a> fan for quite some time and recently I’ve started listening to <a href="http://somafm.com/">SomaFM</a> in the background while I’m doing something productive. I’ve chosen Clementine because it’s the perfect <em>out-of-the-box</em> solution for streaming those two services. In fact, I’m listening to my favourite Digitally Imported station called <a href="http://www.di.fm/bassnjackinhouse">Bass &amp; Jackin’ House</a> right now.</p>

<h3 id="games-2048httpgabrielecirulligithubio2048-0h-h1http0hh1com-and-south-park-the-stick-of-truthhttpsenwikipediaorgwikisouthparkthestickoftruth">Games: <a href="http://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/">2048</a>, <a href="http://0hh1.com/">0h H1</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Park:_The_Stick_of_Truth">South Park: The Stick of Truth</a></h3>

<p>I don’t have any desire to play any complicated graphical game anymore. I’ve started to be a fan of logical games such as 2048 and Oh H1. The reason why I’m loving these two games is because they’re pretty simple to play, and the fact is that I’m not playing them for hours like I’ve used to play games like <a href="http://worldoftanks.eu/">World of Tanks</a> and <a href="https://www.2k.com/games/nba-2k15">NBA by 2k Sports</a>.</p>

<p>From time to time, everyone needs a good amount of laugh. That’s why I really enjoyed playing South Park video game. Simple graphical interface + a good amount of humour is the winning combination in my case. I really wish that there’s a Linux version of it.</p>
