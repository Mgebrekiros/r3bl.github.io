    <p>If you have read any of my previous posts, you probably know that I’m a huge workaholic. I like to <a href="https://r3bl.github.io/en/learn-something-every-day/">learn something new every single day</a>, I like to explore different things and I’m a huge fan of reading books and listening to music.</p>

<p>Now, seven days after my <a href="https://r3bl.github.io/en/evs-netherlands-experience/">volunteering in the Netherlands</a> has finished, I had enough time to look at my life from a different perspective, to find my weaknesses, my advantages, my knowledge gaps etc.</p>

<p>Before my trip, everything in my life was digital. My favorite songs were on my computer, I <a href="https://r3bl.github.io/en/quitting-djing/">DJ-ed for a couple of years</a> using nothing more than my AKAI controller bundled with my favorite DJ-ing software and <em>a lot</em> of digital songs. I’ve read a lot of books from my Kindle account without paying a dime (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/freeebooks">hint</a>) and I had written every single post on this blog using <a href="http://r3bl.github.io/en/why-github-is-my-favorite-company/#atom-text-editor">my favorite text editor</a>. Now, after the trip, the things have kind of changed.</p>

<p>During the trip, I had enough time <em>and</em> money to go to the <a href="http://www.abc.nl/">American Book Center</a> and buy some books, to walk around Amsterdam and to find a couple of stores specialized in selling vinyls and I got a neat notebook designed for students to help me in my future studies! Now, I feel like lots of things have changed.</p>

<h2 id="books">Books</h2>

<p>I’ve started to feel a special bond with the books that I have purchased during my trip. I posses six new books, each of them in their original English editions and I’m starting to fill up my work desk with more than just gadgets.</p>

<p>Although I have possessed three of them already in their digital form (khm, khm, ilegally), I haven’t read neither of them, partially because I didn’t have enough time to do so and partially because I have a huge variety of books that I can get my hands on in a matter of seconds.</p>

<p>Because of that, I often abandon my reading of a certain book and start to read a new one. After that, I just abandon that book and move to some new book. Pretty soon, I have like 10 books that I had started reading but never finished them. Oh, and one more reason for this might be the fact that reading a book on a laptop <em>is</em> a pain in the ass, regardless of the fact that I find it easier than most of the people I know.</p>

<p>Now, the books are right here, on my work desk, filling up that limited amount of space and reminding me that I have to read them. Because of that, my desire for reading is bigger than ever and I am trying to find enough time to read them.</p>

<p>I am no longer obligated to keep an eye of the battery on my laptop while I’m reading a book. I don’t have to struggle with the sun because it is too strong to see my screen clearly. That’s why my bond to them is much stronger than to any book I have laying around on my hard drive. And <a href="https://medium.com/gone/how-this-tokyo-bookstore-made-me-fall-back-in-love-with-print-5674a68d6e59">this exellect article</a> helped me to appreciate them even more!</p>

<p>I have purchased two of the classics: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/573607.The_God_Delusion">The God Delusion</a> by Richard Dawkins and <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22501993-alan-turing">Alan Turing: The Enigma</a> by Andrew Hodges (I had already shared my admiration for Alan Turing’s work <a href="https://r3bl.github.io/en/alan-turing/">here</a>). These two books will, without a doubt, always have a special place on my work desk and in my heart.</p>

<p>Of course, after reading these six books, it will be tough to find printed versions of new books to add to my collection, especially because I’m not really a fan reading books translated to my language, but I will have to find a convenient way to get my hands on them.</p>

<h2 id="vinyls">Vinyls</h2>

<p>If somebody asks me to make a list of my favorite songs, I can guarantee you that none of the songs from Ray Charles or Tom Jones will make it to the list. Well, except this remix:</p>

<iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7H0g1euywnk" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>But that doesn’t stop me for being exceptionally proud of myself for being the new owner of their vinyls. Although I don’t have a vinyl player (or know anyone who has a functioning one), there’s this special bond that I feel right now to those timeless classics such as <em>Hit The Road Jack</em>, <em>It’s Not Unusuall</em> etc. I feel more connected to the history of music. Don’t ask me why because I’m not able to explain it. Maybe I should ask my new friend that I met during my volunteering that has a degree in psychology, huh?</p>

<h2 id="posting-on-my-blog">Posting on my blog</h2>

<p>Although I’m still writing my blog posts using Atom, that notebook I got really helps me to feel inspired about writing. I find it convenient to share my ideas for new posts in it and to write a short breakdown of what my posts should look like. I really do hope that I will take my writing to the next level because of it.</p>

<h2 id="productivity">Productivity</h2>

<p>Now, as for the productivity, I had now returned to my previous habits, but now I realized that although I considered myself as a productive person, I have spent most the 24 hours doing absolutely nothing productive. During the trip, every day was carefully planned and I had managed to accomplish a lot in just one day. Now, I appreciate more each new day and I’m trying to push my limits of what I can accomplish in a single day.</p>

<p>The trip did, without any doubts, changed my perspective of the world. I will forever be grateful to the people that allowed me that opportunity and it is kind of hard to return to my regular life after this trip. But, I will do my best to make an intellectual progress every single day. Hopefully, in a year or two, I will get a chance to get back to that wonderful country and this time for a longer period of time.</p>

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>One month is a short amount of time. But, if you play your cards right, one month can change your perspective on life. And this is exactly what happened to me in the last month.</p>

<h2 id="evs-looking-for-future-springbos-2015">EVS Looking For Future (Springbos 2015)</h2>

<p>I’ve spent the last month in the beautiful county in the western part of Europe called the Netherlands. I stayed in a city called Rijswijk (right next to Den Haag) where I joined seven more short term volunteers.</p>

<p>We represented eight different countries: <strong>Spain</strong> (two short term volunteers, one long term volunteer and one mentor), <strong>Austria</strong> (one short term and one long term volunteer), <strong>Ukraine</strong> (one short term volunteer), <strong>Georgia</strong> (one short term volunteer), <strong>Italy</strong> (one short term volunteer), <strong>Germany</strong> (one long term volunteer), <strong>Slovakia</strong> (one long term volunteer), and of course, <strong>Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina</strong> (two short term volunteers and one long term volunteer). To make things a bit more interesting, we had two coordinators, one from <strong>India</strong> and one from <strong>Belgium</strong> and two mentors from <strong>Indonesia</strong>.</p>

<p>Now that’s a <em>huge</em> cultural clash. Apart from two Spanish guys that knew each other, nobody else had ever met anyone from this group before. We were complete strangers to each other on the first day, but yet we managed to become friends by the end of our journey together.</p>

<h2 id="so-what-did-we-do-in-the-netherlands">So, what did we do in the Netherlands?</h2>

<p>We helped <a href="http://donboscorijswijk.nl/">Don Bosco</a> Youth Center in Rijswijk to create a fresh and interesting program for the children. We worked with the kids for five days a week, we collected 3000€ for the homeless children in Bolivia during the Kingsday (national holiday in the Netherlands), we organized a three day long festival for 300 children that we called Fruitbos, we worked with homeless people in Amsterdam and a whole lot more. Not bad for one month, right?</p>

<p>We had different activities almost every single day and we did our best to contribute to the whole community in Rijswijk and Amsterdam by working with the youngest generations.</p>

<p>We changed each other’s perspective and we got to know different cultures in a way that otherwise would not be possible in such a short amount of time. Now that we are back to our countries, we will do our best to change our local communities in a similar way.</p>

<h2 id="what-did-i-get-from-this-experience">What did I get from this experience?</h2>

<p>The Netherlands is without a doubt the most liberal country in Europe. LGBT community is well accepted in this country, marihuana is legal[1] and prostitution is considered as nothing more than a regular job over there.</p>

<p>People don’t care where are you from, what religion you believe (or not believe) in, which color you are or whether you are a heterosexual or not. It is a country that fits my ideals perfectly and it was a real pleasure to live there for a month.</p>

<p>The Netherlands has an excellent public transport, which allowed me to visit every interesting city or place I wanted to visit in an hour or two. This allowed me to visit a lot of beautiful cities like Rotterdam, Den Haag, Delft, Leiden and Groningen cheaply and quickly. The traveler inside of me was very satisfied because of this.</p>

<p>I got a lot of connections from all over Europe and I experienced a climate that is a lot different than in my home country. I was able to listen to some of my favorite international DJs and producers. I experienced how it feels like to live in a developed country. I improved my English skills, learned a bit of Dutch and even a bit of Spanish. The list of accomplishments just goes on and on.</p>

<h2 id="what-will-be-my-next-step-now">What will be my next step now?</h2>

<p>After this wonderful experience, I’m going to try to work more closely with my youth organization. I’m going to continue studying towards my Bachelor degree and after it, I’m seriously going to consider applying for a Master degree in the Netherlands or finding an internship over there.</p>

<p>This has been my first Dutch experience, but I guarantee you, it won’t be my last. Seriously, I’m in love with this country!</p>

<h2 id="in-the-end">In the end…</h2>

<p>In the end, I wanted to say thank you to all of the volunteers that joined me from all over the Europe, to Dutch volunteers that helped us to feel at home, to students with whom we shared our accommodation, to the coordinators of Don Bosco Youth Center in the Netherlands and to Svitac Youth Center in my own city.</p>

<p>Thank you for this wonderful opportunity. You’ve made this month an unforgettable one for me. It was a real pleasure working with you guys and I do hope that this will not be the last time we meet each other.</p>

<p>[1] Correction: After I did some research, I found out that marihuana is <em>not</em> legal in the Netherlands. It is just tolerated, which means that you are allowed to buy and posses a small amount of it without the consequences. As it turns out, Dutch politicians are trying to make the distribution of marihuana products as tough as possible.</p>

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>I’ve been trying to create a career as a DJ for six years now (I can’t believe it’s been that long!).</p>

<p>It took me almost three years to get to my first gig. I had no internet connection, no specific knowledge and no one to mentor me in the beginning.</p>

<p>The first gig I had was at a DJ-ing contest in my town. I had no equipment, no previous knowledge, but I still managed to get the crowd going and got some kind words from some of the big people around here (maybe you’ve heard of Sinisa Lukic?).</p>

<p>For the next three years, it was a complete failure. To be honest, I had some nice gigs, earned a couple of thousands of dollars, but I played like 30 gigs for free, I was constantly under-payed, worked overtime (as in played 6 hour long set even though I should have played 4 hour long set) a couple of times without earning a single dime as a bonus, and played like 20 gigs with music I absolutely don’t like at all <em>just</em> to earn some spare cash.</p>

<p>I’ve tried producing music in my free time without much of a success. Seriously, I have nothing to show to you guys that I’m satisfied with, but you <em>can</em> hear some of my attempts <a href="htttp://soundcloud.com/r3bldj">here</a>.</p>

<p>I really think that my DJ-ing skills are better than most (if not all) of the DJs around my area have, but I had constantly experimented with different kinds of music, not jumping on the next big bandwagon that was popular at the time. I was experimenting with Trap way back in 2012. Now, it seems like everybody is playing Trap without understanding Trap music at all.</p>

<p>I remember showing some Trap songs (that are now considered as Trap classics) to a couple of my friends. They didn’t like it at all. But now, they can’t wait wait to hear them performed live! Seems like I need new friends, huh!?</p>

<p>At the end, I gave up from playing a specific genre. Now, I started to play every genre I could think of -&gt; <em>in a single set</em>. Seriously, if I’m DJ-ing for something like 6 hours, you can expect me to start with some Deep House, progress my way through Tech House and Future House all the way through Electro and maybe even some Bigroom House. Then, I make a transition down to 100 BPM and start playing some Mid-tempo Trap and Moombahton, mashing some classic Hip-Hop tracks in between. Then, I’m doubling up the BPM and playing a couple of “light” Drum ‘n’ Bass tracks and then I’m lowering the BPM once again and playing some classic Trap songs (at 140 BPM) and I might even put some Hardsyle tracks in that part of the set. Usually, I finish my sets somewhere around 128 BPM with a couple Dub tracks. Hell, I’ve finished my last set with a Tropical House track (if you don’t know what Tropical House is, mark my words, it will get big during the summer).</p>

<p>Now, I should point out that I am still very young. I’m 20 years old now, I’m a student now, and I am pursuing a career in a Computer Science. Keeping up with the music is taking too much of my time and I need to stop doing that to make my career successful.</p>

<p>I have never considered DJ-ing as my career of choice. I had never wanted to become a full-time DJ that is going to pay his rent and his bills with DJ-ing. There were times when I thought about it, but I stayed in school and worked my way through my formal education, not neglecting any part of my life for DJ-ing (well, except sleep).</p>

<p>I’ve never really spent a considerable amount of money on the equipment neither. I’m still using the first controller I got (AKAI APC20) and I love it. A hacker inside of me can think of the ways to work with very limited equipment, as I have proven three years ago when my keyboard mapping was <a href="http://djtechtools.com/2012/03/06/djing-with-a-computer-keyboard/">featured on DJTechTools</a>. All I really need is a good software and a strong motivation. <a href="http://www.native-instruments.com/en/products/traktor/dj-software/traktor-pro-2/">Traktor Pro 2</a> has never let me down, although I had always secretly desired a good open source alternative to it (and although <a href="http://mixxx.org/">Mixxx</a> has the potential of being a great product, it never really satisfied my needs). And that’s it. You don’t actually have to spend a couple of thousand dollars on your equipment if you know what you’re doing.</p>

<p>I used to enjoy learning and working with some music playing in the background. Now, I consider it to be a distraction to get the job done, which is one of the primary reasons I’ve decided to quit DJ-ing.</p>

<p>Now there is a small catch. I strongly believe that <em>everyone</em> has an artist hidden inside of them. Everyone needs a way to express their emotions through some sort of art. And the funny thing is that even though I had started to write this blog 7 months ago just for fun, I found a great joy in writing it and I really feel like writing is my new passion.</p>

<p>I’m quitting DJ-ing for good. Music business is a harsh and non-forgiving world that I don’t want to be a part of anymore.</p>

<p>However, this doesn’t mean that I’m quitting with every side project related to music. Here’s a small rumor: <a href="http://www.di.fm">Digitally Imported</a> might get a new channel called Future House pretty soon. I still might produce a couple of tracks in my free time. And, on top of that, I still have my AKAI APC20, which has a 8x5 LED grid built in. I might create some wacky ass animations on it.</p>

<p>In the end, I want to share with you a post called <a href="http://www.digitaldjtips.com/2015/03/14-things-djing-changes-forever/">14 Things DJing Changes About You Forever</a>. It’s a very interesting (and very accurate) post that describes “consequences” of becoming a DJ. Oh, and expect a new post with a summary of all the things I’ve learned during my 6 years of DJ-ing.</p>

<p>Fuck, I might as well finish this post with my currently favorite track.</p>
