<p><a href="http://openway.si/">OpenWay.si</a> is a conference organized in Novo mesto (Slovenia), promoting open source mentality in different areas. This is their 5th year they’re organizing a conference and it will probably be their biggest conference so far. They’re currently looking for sponsors and speakers, and if you’re interested in helping them, you can apply too.</p>

<h2 id="call-for-speakers">Call for Speakers</h2>

<p>If you think that you have an interesting topic related to open source mentality that you would like to share with a wider audience of people, I suggest you to apply your presentation (or a workshop) to <a href="info@openway.si">info@openway.si</a>. Your application must include your full name, an email address where you can be reached at in any time, your short biography, the title of your presentation and a short description of your presentation (and by short I mean below 300 words). While creating your presentation, please keep in mind that presentations will be 30 minutes long.</p>

<p>Application deadline: 24th of March, 2015.</p>

<h2 id="call-for-sponsors">Call for Sponsors</h2>

<p>If you would like to sponsor Open Way, please contact them on the same email address (<a href="info@openway.si">info@openway.si</a>). You can donate your time, your money or other materials that could help them in the organization of their conference. By doing so, your company will gain visibility and you will prove that you are supporting open source mentality (which could increase your sales quite a bit).</p>

<p>Application deadline: 24th of March, 2015.</p>

<h2 id="more-information">More Information</h2>

<p>For more information, visit <a href="http://openway.si/">their website</a> or check out how their last conference went <a href="http://2014.openway.si/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I won’t be able to attend this conference since I will be volunteering in The Netherlands at that time as a part of the European Volunteering Service (more on that in a few days). But, I highly recommend you to support this conference, and, if you think you can manage that, help them out a bit.</p>

<p>Svaki treći web sajt na svijetu je blog. Tri od četiri internet korisnika redovno čitaju blogove. Svakog dana objavi se blizu 3.000.000 blog postova. Pet od šest internet “influensera” su blogeri, a na njih najveći uticaj vrše opet drugi blogeri.</p>

<p>Od 2012. do danas podaci o broju blogera variraju. Uzveši u obzir sve dostupne podatke - na svijetu postoji između 350 miliona i pola milijarde blogova.</p>

<p>Do momenta kad završite čitanje ovog teksta biće objavljeno preko 20.000 novih blog postova!</p>

<p>Blogosfera bivše Jugoslavije se do 2008. godine eksponencijalno razvijala. U to vrijeme je brojala do čak 1.000.000 blogova. Ali o blogovima u regionu danas znamo manje nego ikada. Blogeri, ne znamo kako ste, a to je važno!</p>

<p><strong>Ne znamo šta blogere muči</strong>, zbog čega ne pišu češće, <strong>da li se osjećaju sigurno</strong> da objave šta god žele, da li dobijaju podršku prijatelja i od koga trpe pritiske (ukoliko ih trpe); ne znamo koliko ima blogova, na kojim su platformama, <strong>da li su blogeri i blogerke upoznati sa svojim pravima</strong>, koliko često su ta njihova prava ugrožena… o Blogerima i blogerkama pouzdano znamo manje nego o bilo kom drugom društvenom mediju. A dok nešto ne izmjerimo, ne možemo ga ni razvijati. Dok ne saznamo kako smo, teško je blogosferu unaprijediti do nivoa najznačajnijeg medija društvenog interneta što bi naša blogosfera sigurno mogla da bude!</p>

<p>elementary OS 0.3 <a href="beta.elementary.io/">Freya Beta 2</a> is out. However, there are things you should not do in the current version of elementary OS. You do not want to make the developers angry, do you?</p>

<h2 id="dont-type-elementary-os-with-the-capital-e-or-refer-to-it-as-eos">1. Don’t type elementary OS with the capital ‘e’ or refer to it as eOS</h2>

<p>elementary OS really cares about their brand. This is why you should always spell the name elementary with the lowercase letter ‘e’ (elementary instead of Elementary).</p>

<p>Also, don’t refer to elementary OS as eOS because developers think that this term is very close to infringing on “iOS”. It reminds people on “eMachines” and they don’t want to see people making “eApps”.</p>

<h2 id="dont-store-important-data-in-the-beta-version-of-elementary-os">2. Don’t store important data in the beta version of elementary OS</h2>

<p>Be sure not to rely on elementary OS Freya Beta 2 while you’re doing something important. Keep in mind that this software is currently in the Beta version, so if you don’t know your way around the system, don’t use it. Use the stable version (<a href="http://elementary.io/">0.2 Luna</a>) instead.</p>

<h2 id="dont-report-bugs-in-our-google-community">3. Don’t report bugs in our Google+ community</h2>

<p>elementary OS has a pretty big and pretty active <a href="https://plus.google.com/communities/104613975513761463450">Google+ community</a> (and you thought nobody is using Google+). You should not post any bugs you encounter on in this Google+ community. Post them <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/elementary">on Launchpad</a> instead. If you have any issues with the new version of the website behind the elementary OS (<a href="http://beta.elementary.io/">beta.elementary.io</a>), post them <a href="https://github.com/elementary/mvp/issues">on GitHub</a>.</p>

<h2 id="dont-try-to-upgrade-your-kernel">4. Don’t try to upgrade your kernel</h2>

<p>There is a pretty good reason why the current version supports the kernel it supports. If you upgrade your kernel to the more recent version, you will probably experience some bugs that would not happen otherwise. Reporting those issues is pointless and makes the development even more difficult than it currently is.</p>

<h2 id="dont-ask-questions-like-why-is-midori-the-default-web-browser-and-why-is-there-no-office-suite-out-of-the-box">5. Don’t ask questions like ‘why is Midori the default web browser’ and ‘why is there no office suite out of the box’</h2>

<p>elementary OS developers want to keep the design of their operating system consistent. Even though Midori is not great, there is just no better web browser that supports headerbars out of the box. This is why there is no way for Firefox (or Chrome) to be included in the elementary OS instead of Midori.</p>

<p>The same thing applies to LibreOffice. It does not support headerbars, it does not look good out of the box with elementary OS, therefore, it is not available with the installation of elementary OS.</p>

<p>This is also true for applications like VLC player, Clementine, etc.</p>

<h4 id="so-why-doesnt-elementary-os-just-fork-these-projects-and-change-their-design-to-fit-elementary-os">So, why doesn’t elementary OS just fork these projects and change their design to fit elementary OS?</h4>

<p>The main reason behind this decision is because elementary OS currently has a pretty small developer community. More developers = more features. If you want to help out elementary OS when you don’t have any coding skills, keep in mind that more donations = more developers = more features.</p>

<h2 id="follow-the-rules-if-you-want-to-use-the-freya-beta-version">Follow the rules if you want to use the Freya beta version</h2>

<p>elementary OS Freya Beta 2 is excellent and it is going to be a pretty amazing project <em>once it becomes stable</em>. If you want your system to be stable, you should use the <a href="http://elementary.io/">0.2 Luna version</a> or look for an alternative operating system until Freya becomes stable.</p>

<p>If you use the beta version, follow these rules or you’re on your own.</p>

<h2 id="bonus">Bonus</h2>

<p>Don’t post “Things you should do after installing elementary OS Freya” posts on your blog yet. Freya is currently <em>not</em> stable and it probably won’t be for at least two more months. Keep that in mind before posting an article of this kind.</p>

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>A few days ago, while I was watching <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/87th_Academy_Awards">87th Academy Awards</a>, I made a list of the movies I really wanted to see. On top of that list was a movie called <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2084970/">The Imitation Game (2014)</a>. This movie follows the life of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing">Alan Turing</a>, the man I deeply admire for a couple of months now.</p>

<p><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/ba/Sackville_Park_Turing_plaque.jpg" alt="image" /></p>

<p>Just 24 hours ago, I had no idea how much of an influence Alan Turing had, not just to the field of artificial intelligence, but to the history of the world as well, especially in the technology we use today.</p>

<p>Alan Turing truly was a genius. Probably one of the biggest geniuses in his generation, that is. He had some key contributions in breaking the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enigma_machine">Enigma machine</a> during the World War II, which had a huge impact on the result of World War II. He <a href="http://m.bbc.com/news/technology-18475646">pioneered</a> the work in artificial intelligence (even before the term artificial intelligence was established), where he was the first one to discuss the ways of replicating human brain inside of a machine. His papers remain relevant today, 60 years after they were published. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test">Turing test</a> (a test which is used to determine is a machine intelligence really indistinguishable from human intelligence) is, of course, named after him as his creator and there’s an annual contest going on each year.</p>

<p>So, how did the U.K. thank him for his work? By convicting him because of his sexual orientation. He had a choice to accept a hormone treatment or to spend two years in prison. He chose the first option and continued his work.</p>

<p>He was found dead two years later. Even though it was believed for more than 50 years that he had committed suicide by eating a poisonous apple (allegedly inspired by his favorite fairy tale Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs), there are some indications that his death might be an accident as <a href="http://m.bbc.com/news/science-environment-18561092">explained</a> by Roland Pease.</p>

<p>Even though the movie has received some excellent reviews and won an Oscar for the Best Adapted Screenplay, not everyone agrees that this movie is historically accurate (as described <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Imitation_Game#Controversy">here</a> and <a href="http://www.nybooks.com/blogs/nyrblog/2014/dec/19/poor-imitation-alan-turing/">here</a>).</p>

<p>But, this historical inaccuracy managed to convince me to look for more sources and to find more information about his life. Even though there are quite a lot of different views on his life, all of them agree that he had an interesting, out of the ordinary life, and that he managed to do some of the most amazing technological work at the time.</p>

<p>I really consider him as <a href="http://m.bbc.com/news/technology-18327261">the father of computing</a> and I can’t stop wondering: if he was still alive, would he be completely proud of what we’ve accomplished so far or would he think that we could do much more?</p>

<p>Anyway, back to the subject. Because of the movie inaccuracy and the fact that there are so many different ways to learn about Alan Turing, I have decided to create a separate repository with a single Markdown document where I will try to put all of the informations about Alan Turing (and his work) that I can find. I really think that he is an important person in history and that more people need to be educated on what he has really accomplished. This is just a small way of helping people to learn.</p>

    <p>Sure, you might be satisfied with the courses your college is offering. But what if you’re not? What if you want to improve it? What if you want to learn some skill that your college is not offering as a part of their program?</p>

<p>We used to be limited by the courses our colleges are offering  us. Sure, if we wanted to learn something new and exciting, we could always buy a book or two and learn a new skill. But, thanks to the Internet, now there is a better way to learn.</p>

<h2 id="the-mit-challenge">The MIT Challenge</h2>

<p>The MIT Challenge is a project by <a href="http://www.scotthyoung.com/">Scott H. Young</a> that he started in 2011. Explained as short as possible, he tried to replicate MIT’s 4-year Computer Science Curriculum using courses offered by the MIT itself on their <a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm">OpenCourseWare platform</a>. He managed to successfully replicate a curriculum that’s nearly identical to the curriculum offered by the MIT, and he managed to learn the four year curriculum in a year! For more details, see <a href="http://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/mit-challenge/">his blog post</a>.</p>

<p>Of course, you might argue that he didn’t finish MIT program <em>per se</em>, and you will be right. He did not get an actual diploma from MIT, he never even visited MIT, he graded himself and he did not enjoy any other privileges offered by the MIT as a part of their program. But what he did do is he managed to learn pretty much everything offered by the MIT in under a year for a price that’s <em>a lot</em> less expensive than actually going to MIT.</p>

<p>When he started the challenge, he believed that the diploma is overrated in todays world (something I completely agree with). It gave him a unique perspective on learning and education, as he said to me in an email response. As far as he knows, nobody was able to replicate his project so far. He proved to himself that he’s capable of doing a lot more than he used to think. He was not interested in an MIT diploma. What he <em>was</em> interested in was the Computer Science, and he (in his own words) managed to learn a great deal of Computer Science and he perfected his programming skills. Of course, if he wanted to specialize in something, he’d probably need more specific training in that field.</p>

<p>His idea might be a little extreme, but he might be up to something. He encouraged me to look at my college curriculum from a critical point of view. This is why I have decided to improve my curriculum a little bit.</p>

<h2 id="the-situation-in-bosnia--herzegovina">The Situation in Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina</h2>

<p>Before I talk about a way for you to improve your curriculum, I kind of wanted to tell you a short story of why I have decided to so.</p>

<p>You’re probably aware that Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina is not very familiar as a country with a good higher education. Here, there’s a constant debate whether or not young people should go to private or state colleges. State colleges are a little overrated and private colleges are considered a joke that anyone is capable of finishing. And I’m not blaming them, because they’re right in 90% of cases. It is nearly impossible to get a job in my country if you finish a private college in, lets say, law, medicine, or economics, and there’s a good reason for that. But the situation is quite different if you’re learning Computer Science.</p>

<p>My college is pretty small and unknown even in my country. We only have about 150 students (in all years), our college staff is pretty small (I would say that my college has less than 30 employees), and we don’t actually have the comfort of choosing subjects that we’re going to take.</p>

<p>Even though our teachers are learning us the knowledge needed to get a job right after getting a college diploma, we are constantly limited to use a certain tool or to follow a certain path to the solution to a problem. Most of the students are comfortable with it, but I am not, mostly because I don’t feel comfortable with being obliged to use Microsoft’s tools to get the job done (I’m not saying that we’re using Microsoft’s tools <em>exclusively</em>, but in most of the subjects they are a huge part of our curriculum).</p>

<p>So what I need to do is to think outside of the box. I needed to find a way to learn specific things to pass my exams, but I also needed to be able to apply my theoretical knowledge in a wider area of situations, using the tools I’m comfortable with and learning the tools outside of my regular curriculum. So what I ended up doing is basically creating a Curriculum 2.0.</p>

<h2 id="presenting-you-curriculum-20">Presenting You: Curriculum 2.0</h2>

<p>You’ve probably heard about Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) somewhere in the past and there’s a good reason for that: MOOCs are an easy way to learn about topics that you’re interested in by attending an online course offered by some of the biggest universities in the world. And there are thousands of them available on platforms like <a href="https://www.coursera.org/">Coursera</a>, <a href="https://www.edx.org/">Edx</a>, <a href="https://www.udacity.com/">Udacity</a> and <a href="https://www.udemy.com/">Udemy</a>. Most of them are offered free of charge to anyone who’s interested in learning. All you need to do is to pay a small fee if you’re interested in getting a certificate as a way of proving that you’ve successfully finished them.</p>

<p>But why not take it to another level, like Scott taught us? If you’re not satisfied with your course curriculum, why not taking an online course at the same time as your course in college? What you’ll end up doing is learning the same thing from two different sources. By doing so, you’re not obliged to follow a specific rule to get the job done. You can learn two or more ways of doing the same thing. You can become proficient in more programming languages then you’re going to learn in college. You can learn about algorithms from a wide variety of resources. What you’ll end up doing is passing the course and getting a certificate from two different universities for learning basically the same thing.</p>

<p>Of course, this is not an easy task and you’ll run into lots of problems. You’ll have to learn to be proficient in your time management skills. You’ll have to study more and you’ll have to have a high level of productivity a day after day. I ended up taking a year off just to perfect my skills in areas where I thought I need to improve. But after going through all of this hustle, I finally think that I’m ready to incorporate all of that in my curriculum. In the meantime, I managed to improve my English proficiency, to practice my writing skills and to highly increase my level of productivity. I used to spend days without doing anything productive. Now, more than 50% of time I’m using my laptop is spent by doing something productive (and I know that thanks to this awesome freemuium service called <a href="https://www.rescuetime.com/">RescueTime</a>). Sure, it is far from perfect, but I am improving <em>a lot</em>. Half of a year later, I’m not regretting my decision to take a year off at all as I have only benefited by doing so.</p>

<h2 id="so-whats-my-point">So, What’s My Point?</h2>

<p>If you want to learn something new, you <em>can</em> always find the time to do that. If you want to learn a specific skill, there <em>is</em> a MOOC that will teach you that. You <em>can</em> earn a bunch of certificates while you’re in a college. You can even get a <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations">specialization</a> on Coursera or a <a href="https://www.udacity.com/nanodegree">nanodegree</a> on Udacity. And the best thing is, you can do all of this for free or by paying a pretty small fee that probably anyone could afford. If you’re passionate about learning, there’s nothing that could stop you.</p>
