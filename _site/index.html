  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>I know that we live in a shitty part of the world. But getting pulled over by a police officer and suggesting that he requested a bribe from you simply because you misunderstood him is a new level of being a huge douchebag.</p>

<h2 id="the-story">The Story</h2>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IPhYl81--fY" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p><a href="http://watchdog.org/">Watchdog</a> reporter called <a href="http://watchdog.org/author/yael/">Yaël Ossowski</a> came to our region to cover the story of <a href="https://liberland.org/en/main/">Libreland</a>, a small (7 square kilometers) self-proclaimed country sitting between Serbia and Croatia. I don’t know if he published the story or not, but there was an event after it that got huge attention not just in Serbia, but in our entire region.</p>

<p>He was pulled over for speeding by a Serbian police officer near the border of Serbia and Hungary. The officer who stopped him did not speak English and he did his very best to explain to the journalist the law that applies for the speeding violation in Serbia. He remained calm during the process and once he realized that they can’t communicate and solve the issue on their own, the police officer decided to call one of his colleagues that spoke English.</p>

<p>To explain the procedure shortly, the price for speeding is 5,000 RSD (approximately 41 EUR). If the violator pays his fine to the police officer right on the spot, he does not pay the full amount of the fine. He only pays 50% of the fine, which is 2,500  RSD (approximately 20 EUR). In both cases, he needs to pay additional 45 RSD (approximately 0,4 EUR) to a post office, which is a tax that post offices take for transferring the money to the state. If a foreign citizen does not have the appropriate amount of money to pay his fine right on the spot, the police officer by Serbian law has the right to confiscate his passport for up to five days until the voilator pays his fine. The violator cannot pay his fine in a foreign currency. Serbia has their own currency (RSD) and unlike most of the Europe, they currently do not accept EUR as their official currency.</p>

<p>As the police officer tried to explain the procedure to the reporter, reporter claimed that the police officer requested him to pay 3,500 RSD. There’s absolutely no proof for this accusation anywhere on the video. You don’t need to take it from me, ask anyone who can speak both Serbian and English regardless of their nationality and they will tell you the same.</p>

<p>The video went viral all over Serbia, Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina and Croatia. Now as you may know, those three countries were at war 20 years ago after the collapse of Yugoslavia. The nations from these countries still haven’t forgot about the war and there’s still a huge tension between those nations (especially in Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina). And then, the reporter tweeted this:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">It seems the nationalists have been set loose. Please read the description of the video. Cop was very happy to accept 50 euros in cash</p>&mdash; Yaël (@YaelOss) <a href="https://twitter.com/YaelOss/status/606367814484664320">June 4, 2015</a></blockquote>
<script async="" src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Now let me tell you something. Uniting the citizens of these three countries over <em>anything</em> is a <em>huge</em> accomplishment for anyone. We do not consider ourselves as the same nation. As an example, if you say to a Serbian that he has the same nationality as a Croatian, in most of the cases, that would be considered as a <em>huge</em> disrespect and some people might even take it as an insult. The same thing applies vise versa. But the fact is that our languages are pretty much the same (I would say around 98%). We can understand each other perfectly, but we will never say that we speak the same language. This is why you have people from all three countries defending the police officer in the comments on the video. As a conclusion, calling us nationalists is just completely incorrect.</p>

<p>Now this video managed to go viral because the reporter showed a huge disrespect towards the police officer. In our countries, insulting the police officer (especially as a foreign citizen) is considered as an insult to the country that he represents. The violator and his colleagues even made a couple of jokes towards Serbia as a country throughout the video, disrespecting the whole country in the process.</p>

<p>The reporter was requested to sign a document admitting that he made a violation. The document was written in Serbian language and the reporter was not able to understand the document he was requested to sign. He has every right to complain about this issue and I’m pretty sure that the police officers would give him the same document translated to English if he followed them to a police station. Unfortunately, the police officers did not have the English version of the document at the spot. Eventually, the reporter went to the nearest exchange office, exchanged his money to an appropriate currency and signed the document he did not understand. After doing so, police officers returned him his passport and he was free to go.</p>

<p>As a reporter, Yaël behaved inappropriately. He tried to accuse Serbian police officer for something he did not do without any evidence supporting his claims. I’m not a reporter, but I am pretty sure that this is completely against his ethics. He still remains ignorant and he does not accept the fact that he is wrong, even though lots and lots of people tried to explain to him the process by commenting on his video, on the post he published on his blog and on Twitter. And on top of that, he is mocking the country of Serbia in the process, with tweets like this one:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I &lt;3 Serbia <a href="http://t.co/A4hveVLrAB">pic.twitter.com/A4hveVLrAB</a></p>&mdash; Yaël (@YaelOss) <a href="https://twitter.com/YaelOss/status/606393796708978688">June 4, 2015</a></blockquote>
<script async="" src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Now please, if you are visiting a foreign country and you get pulled over by a cop, show some respect. Don’t make false accusations. If you’re a reporter, don’t try to make the story where there is no story. And above all, do not insult the citizens of a foreign country and their whole country in the process. Yaël did not behave very civilized. Let this be an example to you how not to behave.</p>

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>GitHub is growing out of the place where you just share your code to something bigger for a while now. Of course, GitHub is still an awesome place to share your code, but there’s more to it. Way more.</p>

<h2 id="you-dont-have-to-be-a-programmer-to-be-a-part-of-the-open-source-project">You don’t have to be a programmer to be a part of the open source project</h2>

<p>I said it (and wrote it) a thousand times, and yet, I feel the urge to say it again. There’s <a href="http://opensource.com/business/14/12/8-ways-contribute-open-source-without-writing-code">more to it</a> than actually writing code. Open source is a self-suficient economy. It’s a way for the people to collaborate, no matter what their expertise is, on a scale that was not possible ever before. And if you’re actually a part of the open source project, there’s no better place to share it <a href="http://opensource.com/life/15/2/beginners-guide-github">than on GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>Now some people might argue that the people used open source software as a way of collaboration for over 20 years, and that’s true. However, I firmly believe that this collaboration has never happened on such a massive scale as it is happening right now. I firmly believe that GitHub, although not the first service who enabled this kind of service, really managed to make a change. GitHub managed to make a service that is easy to use, easy to access and easy to learn. Suddenly, Git doesn’t really seem like a hard thing to learn. And because of that, open source kind of collaboration is now expanding to more than software.  </p>

<h2 id="github-as-a-place-to-collaborate-on-various-projects">GitHub as a place to collaborate on various projects</h2>

<p>There’s lots of things that people want to collaborate on, not just the software. People can do that even easier than ever. Some people want to share <a href="https://github.com/d2kagw/cooking">their cooking recipes</a>, some people want to <a href="https://github.com/crypto101/book">write a book together</a>, and some people want to share their recommendations on various subjects.</p>

<h3 id="presenting-you-githubs-awesome-lists">Presenting you: GitHub’s awesome lists!</h3>

<p>There’s a special repository hosted on GitHub that I really became a fan of recently, and it’s called <a href="https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome">awesome</a>. Basically, it’s a list of awesome lists hosted on GitHub. People want to share their recommendations on various subjects, and now they can. Sure, on that list, you’ll see plenty of lists that will help you to learn more about Computers and IT, but if you look closely, I’m pretty sure you’ll find something for yourself. Like, a list of <a href="https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome-scifi">SciFi novels and movies</a>, or a list of <a href="https://github.com/RichardLitt/awesome-fantasy">Fantasy movies and novels</a>, a list of <a href="https://github.com/najela/discount-for-student-dev">discounts for students</a>, a list of <a href="https://github.com/lukasz-madon/awesome-remote-job">remote working resources</a>,
a list of <a href="https://github.com/RichardLitt/awesome-conferences">conferences</a>, <a href="https://github.com/kyleterry/awesome-radio">radio resources</a>, <a href="https://github.com/jugoncalves/awesome-answers">places to look for answers</a>, <a href="https://github.com/cv/awesome-geek-podcasts">geek podcasts</a>, <a href="https://github.com/heyalexej/awesome-images">free images</a>, and even a list of awesome <a href="https://github.com/matiassingers/awesome-readme">README files</a>.</p>

<p>And that’s the point of that awesome repository. To combine the list of awesome lists. Every single person can contribute to them, making them bigger and better.</p>

<p>So go ahead and pick one. Share your recommendation with others. Encourage others to do so too. Learn together and share together what you’ve learned.</p>

<h3 id="my-awesome-lists">My awesome lists</h3>

<p>Now I’m going to share with you what I’ve done so far. I’m hosting an <a href="https://github.com/aleksandar-todorovic/awesome-c">awesome-c list</a>, a place to share the awesome resources for C programming language all across the Internet. Thanks to my work, I became a collaborator on the <a href="https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome-scifi">awesome-scifi</a> list where you can share your recommendations on anything related to Science Fiction. And finally, I have created a list that will contain links to great blogs all across the Internet called <a href="https://github.com/aleksandar-todorovic/awesome-blogs">awesome-blogs</a>. Feel free to check them out, see our recommendations and share yours. Sure, open source software <em>is</em> great, but lets collaborate on more than just software! Let’s collaborate on everything you can possibly imagine!</p>

  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>What does it mean to be an open source advocate? Can I really make a difference? How do I do that? There are so many questions about the Open Source Advocacy and, surprisingly, so little answers available.</p>

<h2 id="why-do-i-call-myself-an-open-source-advocate">Why do I call myself an Open Source Advocate?</h2>

<p>I’ve been calling myself an Open Source Advocate for a while now. Not because I consider myself as an influential person, but because I can’t find a more suitable title that covers what I do in my free time.</p>

<p>I’m not really an open source programmer. Although I know the syntax of five or six programming languages, I do not consider myself as an expert in neither of them (for now). That’s why my coding contributions are pretty limited so far.</p>

<p>I’m not a designer neither. I just don’t see myself as one. I like to use well-designed programs and web services, but I’m not familiar nor interested in the process of making a well designed program / web service.</p>

<p>Now what I’m good at is actually testing the software, reporting bugs, trying out new features and tools, translating projects to my native language, communicating with the people representing various open source projects and, most of all, actually talking about the open source software on my blog.</p>

<p>And that’s where I found myself. That’s the beauty of open source. There’s something to do for everyone.</p>

<p>If you want to contribute to an open source project, you can. No matter what’s your area of expertise. All you need is your willingness to do something. To make a change… After all, <a href="https://r3bl.github.io/en/every-one-of-us-changes-the-world-in-one-way-or-another/">we’re all shaping the world</a> with every single step we take.</p>

    <p>Have you ever seen movies or read books about Harry Potter? If you did, then you might be familiar with the term Marauder’s Map. If you’re not a Harry Potter fan or the term doesn’t ring a bell, here’s a one minute video that will explain the basic concept to you:</p>

<iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WVBha-QUUCE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>So basically, in Harry Potter’s world, Marauder’s map is a map that allows you to see the exact location of every single person inside of Hogwarts at any given point of time. Handy, isn’t it? Well, thanks to the technology and Facebook’s amazing features, this map has now become a reality.</p>

<h2 id="i-present-to-you-the-real-marauders-map">I present to you: The real Marauder’s map!</h2>

<p><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/marauders-map/mliofombcghaamgjkmmmmlepkiacdhkh">Marauder’s map</a> is a Chrome extension that shows you the map with the exact location of your friends (we’ll talk about how this works in a minute).</p>

<p>Simply install it, navigate to <code>https://www.facebook.com/messages/</code>, select a conversation with the friend whose location you want to see and their location will “magically” appear on the map.</p>

<p>It doesn’t even have to be an individual friend. This extension works with group conversations too! It even works with the people you don’t have in your list of friends.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What the hell? How does this work?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Every time you send a message using a Messenger app, with that message you’re also sending your exact GPS location to the receiver of the message <em>by default</em>. Finding out the ways to exploit this data is a fairly simple process, isn’t it?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I don’t want other people spying on me! How do I fight this thing?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Simply open the settings of your Messenger app and turn off the location sending (again, this is on <em>by default</em>).</p>

    <p>You’re probably wondering what the hell is a post about terrorism doing on a primarily IT oriented blog? Well, I got interested in the term cyber terrorism. I want learn more about this term: is cyber terrorism possible, how to fight against it, etc.</p>

<p>To get an answer to questions on cyber terrorism, I wanted to look at the basics: what terrorism is and is it a real threat. So, I visited a couple of sites that I usually use to learn something new and I found out about the course called <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/terrorism">Terrorism and Counterterrorism: Comparing Theory and Practice</a> offered by the <a href="http://leiden.edu/">University of Leiden</a>. I have to say that my recent <a href="https://r3bl.github.io/en/evs-netherlands-experience/">volunteering experience</a> had a huge impact of selecting this course over any other way of studying this subject. Seriously, the city Leiden is freaking beautiful!</p>

<p>I finished three weeks of the course in the last three days and now that I have <em>some</em> prior knowledge about the subject, I wanted to share with you some common assumptions about the terrorism and to clarify whether are they true or not.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.nationofchange.org/2015/wp-content/uploads/terrorism12115.jpg" alt="terrorism" /></p>

<h2 id="what-is-terrorism">What is terrorism?</h2>

<p>This might be the biggest question in the field of terrorism to answer. Terrorism is a <em>highly</em> subjective term. We do not have a widely accepted definition of this term and this has proven to be one of the major obstacles in actually fighting against terrorism. After all, how can you fight against something if you cannot properly define it?</p>

<p>There are different reasons why this term is hard to define, but because I want this article to be short and straightforward, I’ll skip writing about those reasons now.</p>

<p>For the sake of actually writing the rest of this article, I will borrow the definition from the Oxford dictionary, mostly because this definition seems like the easiest one to understand:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Terrorism is the unofficial use of violence and intimidation in the pursuit of political aims.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="assumption-no1-terrorism-is-caused-by-poverty">Assumption no.1: Terrorism is caused by poverty</h3>

<p>This is a myth. Nothing else. There are lots of examples of wealthy terrorists. There are no direct links between terrorism and poverty what so ever. It is true in some individual cases, but poverty is <em>not</em> the root cause of the problem.</p>

<p>Why is it important to beat this assumption? Well, if this assumption was true, then we would have a pretty straightforward way of actually fighting against terrorism. Terrorism would be yet just another reason on why we should fight against the poverty in the third world countries. Unfortunately, this is not the case.</p>

<h3 id="assumption-no2-terrorists-are-crazy">Assumption no.2: Terrorists are crazy</h3>

<p>In this assumption, we again face the problem of actually defining the terms such as “crazy” and “insane”. Both of those terms are highly subjective.</p>

<p>It is easy to assume why we assume that the terrorists are crazy. After all, it is hard for us to realize that the rational person (someone just like you and me) could ever do such a thing as killing (mostly) innocent people to achieve certain goals.</p>

<p>However, I do have to disappoint you. Although this assumption is <em>not</em> a myth, it <em>is</em> false. Terrorism is a rational behavior making terrorists rational actors that kill to achieve certain political goals.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“They [terrorists] are not depressed and not severely emotionally disturbed, nor are they crazed fanatics. In fact, terrorist groups and organizations regularly weed out emotionally unstable individuals. They represent, after all, a security risk.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why is it important to debunk this myth? Well, if it <em>were</em> true, and if the terrorists <em>were</em> really crazy, then there would be no point in fighting against terrorism. We could not investigate their motives. It would mean that they’re simply crazy. And I think that you would all agree when I say that labeling crazy persons as potential terrorists and discriminating them because of that would not be really democratic.</p>

<h3 id="assumption-no3-terrorism-is-increasingly-lethal">Assumption no.3: Terrorism is increasingly lethal</h3>

<p>Here, we will have to divide this assumption in two pieces:</p>

<ol>
  <li>There are more terrorist attacks than ever before.</li>
  <li>Terrorist attacks kill more people than ever before.</li>
</ol>

<p>If this assumption proves to be true, then it is easy to say that we have to devote more means to fight against terrorism than ever before. If this assumption proves to be false, then it is easy to say that it might be better to spend more money and resources on something else.</p>

<p>So, is the terrorism becoming more lethal? Well, yes and no. The worldwide number of terrorist victims worldwide has its ups and downs over the years. The number of victims has not increased after 9/11 as many people assume it did. However, the number of victims per attack has increased.</p>

<p>We can say that this assumption is partially true. Number of victims per attack <em>is</em> increasing, but the worldwide number of terrorist victims per year is <em>not</em> going straight upwards.</p>

<h3 id="assumption-no4-terrorism-is-predominately-anti-western">Assumption no.4: Terrorism is predominately anti-western</h3>

<p>If we mistakenly assume that this is true, we could make anti-western groups even bigger than ever before, we could increase the struggle between Christianity and Islam and this could lead to generalization and stereotyping against certain groups.</p>

<p>As you can see, this assumption is highly delicate. However, it is not really true. We <em>do</em> have a higher number of threats against the western world than ever before. But lets look at the actual number of victims. Between 2005 and 2010, somewhere between 82 and 97% of <em>all</em> terrorist victims worldwide were actually Muslim. Most of them were victims of separatist groups in places where Muslim population is a majority, places like Pakistan, Afghanistan, some central parts of Africa and southern parts of Russia.</p>

<p>As a conclusion, the number of anti-western threats is increasing, but the majority of the actual victims of terrorist attacks are not located in the western parts of the world.</p>

<h3 id="assumption-no5-terrorism-is-successful">Assumption no.5: Terrorism is successful</h3>

<p>To fight against this assumption, first we have to define what makes a terrorist attack successful. Is it the number of casualties? Is it the ability to spread fear? Is it the number of cases where terrorists managed to fulfill their political goals?</p>

<p>It is surprising to know that <em>only</em> 7% of the time terrorists actually managed to accomplish their political goals. Of those 7%, majority of the attacks were conducted against military victims, not civilians. In fact, if we look at the stats, we can safely say that if the terrorist group attacks civilians, their chances of actually achieving their political goals are negligible.</p>

<p>But are terrorists actually succeeding is spreading fear? Surprisingly, the number of people that are worried about themselves or the members of their family actually becoming victims of the terrorist attack is not increasing in the western world. It remains pretty much the same now as it did prior to 9/11. Of course, it is true to say that this number was peaking right after the 9/11 attack. But, apart from that, nothing is changing. Somewhere between 25 and 42% of people in the U.S. are concerned of becoming the victims of a terrorist attack. The number is way lower in European countries. The situation was pretty much the same prior to 9/11.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Terrorists often succeed tactically and thereby gain attention, cause alarms, and attract recruits. But their struggle has brought them no success measured against their own stated goals. In that sense, terrorism has failed, but the phenomenon of terrorism continues.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="so-is-the-fear-justified">So, is the fear justified?</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Between 1981 and 1986, more news stories were broadcast [by the three TV networks, ABC, CBS, and NBC] on terrorism than on poverty, unemployment, racial inequality, and crime combined.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The propaganda against terrorism is strong. It is stronger than ever. Terrorism, on the other side, is not. Terrorism is a threat, but it is not as big of a threat as medias, politicians, and public figures make it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The main education of the public on terrorism is via the media and frequent misuse of the word will result in it becoming a meaningless cliché.”</p>
</blockquote>
