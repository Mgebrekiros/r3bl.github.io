  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Sure, you might be satisfied with the courses your collage is offering. But what if you’re not? What if you want to improve it? What if you want to learn some skill that your collage is not offering as a part of their program?</p>

<p>We used to be limited by the courses our collages are offering  us. Sure, if we wanted to learn something new and exciting, we could always buy a book or two and learn a new skill. But, thanks to the Internet, now there is a better way to learn.</p>

<h2 id="the-mit-challenge">The MIT Challenge</h2>

<p>The MIT Challenge is a project by <a href="http://www.scotthyoung.com/">Scott H. Young</a> that he started in 2011. Explained as short as possible, he tried to replicate MIT’s 4-year Computer Science Curriculum using courses offered by the MIT itself on their <a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm">OpenCourseWare platform</a>. He managed to successfully replicate a curriculum that’s nearly identical to the curriculum offered by the MIT, and he managed to learn the four year curriculum in a year! For more details, see <a href="http://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/mit-challenge/">his blog post</a>.</p>

<p>Of course, you might argue that he didn’t finish MIT program <em>per se</em>, and you will be right. He did not get an actual diploma from MIT, he never even visited MIT, he graded himself and he did not enjoy any other privileges offered by the MIT as a part of their program. But what he did do is he managed to learn pretty much everything offered by the MIT in under a year for a price that’s <em>a lot</em> less expensive than actually going to MIT.</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/piSLobJfZ3c" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>When he started the challenge, he believed that the diploma is overrated in todays world (something I completely agree with). It gave him a unique perspective on learning and education, as he said to me in an email response. As far as he knows, nobody was able to replicate his project so far. He proved to himself that he’s capable of doing a lot more than he used to think. He was not interested in an MIT diploma. What he <em>was</em> interested in was the Computer Science, and he (in his own words) managed to learn a great deal of Computer Science and he perfected his programming skills. Of course, if he wanted to specialize in something, he’d probably need more specific training in that field.</p>

<p>His idea might be a little extreme, but he might be up to something. He encouraged me to look at my collage curriculum from a critical point of view. This is why I have decided to improve my curriculum a little bit.</p>

<h2 id="the-situation-in-bosnia--herzegovina">The Situation in Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina</h2>

<p>Before I talk about a way for you to improve your curriculum, I kind of wanted to tell you a short story of why I have decided to so.</p>

<p>You’re probably aware that Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina is not very familiar as a country with a good higher education. Here, there’s a constant debate whether or not young people should go to private or state collages. State collages are a little overrated and private collages are considered a joke that anyone is capable of finishing. And I’m not blaming them, because they’re right in 90% of cases. It is nearly impossible to get a job in my country if you finish a private collage in, lets say, law, medicine, or economics, and there’s a good reason for that. But the situation is quite different if you’re learning Computer Science.</p>

<p>My collage is pretty small and unknown even in my country. We only have about 150 students (in all years), our collage staff is pretty small (I would say that my collage has less than 30 employees), and we don’t actually have the comfort of choosing subjects that we’re going to take.</p>

<p>Even though our teachers are learning us the knowledge needed to get a job right after getting a collage diploma, we are constantly limited to use a certain tool or to follow a certain path to the solution to a problem. Most of the students are comfortable with it, but I am not, mostly because I don’t feel comfortable with being obliged to use Microsoft’s tools to get the job done (I’m not saying that we’re using Microsoft’s tools <em>exclusively</em>, but in most of the subjects they are a huge part of our curriculum).</p>

<p>So what I need to do is to think outside of the box. I needed to find a way to learn specific things to pass my exams, but I also needed to be able to apply my theoretical knowledge in a wider area of situations, using the tools I’m comfortable with and learning the tools outside of my regular curriculum. So what I ended up doing is basically creating a Curriculum 2.0.</p>

<h2 id="presenting-you-curriculum-20">Presenting You: Curriculum 2.0</h2>

<p>You’ve probably heard about Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) somewhere in the past and there’s a good reason for that: MOOCs are an easy way to learn about topics that you’re interested in by attending an online course offered by some of the biggest universities in the world. And there are thousands of them available on platforms like <a href="https://www.coursera.org/">Coursera</a>, <a href="https://www.edx.org/">Edx</a>, <a href="https://www.udacity.com/">Udacity</a> and <a href="https://www.udemy.com/">Udemy</a>. Most of them are offered free of charge to anyone who’s interested in learning. All you need to do is to pay a small fee if you’re interested in getting a certificate as a way of proving that you’ve successfully finished them.</p>

<p>But why not take it to another level, like Scott taught us? If you’re not satisfied with your course curriculum, why not taking an online course at the same time as your course in collage? What you’ll end up doing is learning the same thing from two different sources. By doing so, you’re not obliged to follow a specific rule to get the job done. You can learn two or more ways of doing the same thing. You can become proficient in more programming languages then you’re going to learn in collage. You can learn about algorithms from a wide variety of resources. What you’ll end up doing is passing the course and getting a certificate from two different universities for learning basically the same thing.</p>

<p>Of course, this is not an easy task and you’ll run into lots of problems. You’ll have to learn to be proficient in your time management skills. You’ll have to study more and you’ll have to have a high level of productivity a day after day. I ended up taking a year off just to perfect my skills in areas where I thought I need to improve. But after going through all of this hustle, I finally think that I’m ready to incorporate all of that in my curriculum. In the meantime, I managed to improve my English proficiency, to practice my writing skills and to highly increase my level of productivity. I used to spend days without doing anything productive. Now, more than 50% of time I’m using my laptop is spent by doing something productive (and I know that thanks to this awesome freemuium service called <a href="https://www.rescuetime.com/">RescueTime</a>). Sure, it is far from perfect, but I am improving <em>a lot</em>. Half of a year later, I’m not regretting my decision to take a year off at all as I have only benefited by doing so.</p>

<h2 id="so-whats-my-point">So, What’s My Point?</h2>

<p>If you want to learn something new, you <em>can</em> always find the time to do that. If you want to learn a specific skill, there <em>is</em> a MOOC that will teach you that. You <em>can</em> earn a bunch of certificates while you’re in a collage. You can even get a <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations">specialization</a> on Coursera or a <a href="https://www.udacity.com/nanodegree">nanodegree</a> on Udacity. And the best thing is, you can do all of this for free or by paying a pretty small fee that probably anyone could afford. If you’re passionate about learning, there’s nothing that could stop you.</p>

      <h1 class="entry-title"><a href="https://r3bl.github.io/en/ai-already-changing-the-world/" rel="bookmark" title="How AI is Already Changing the World" itemprop="url">How AI is Already Changing the World</a></h1>
    
  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Artificial Intelligence is not only <em>going to</em> change the world. It already <em>has</em> changed the world. There’s a lot of difference between those two statements.</p>

<p>To talk about this, first, we need to agree on what Artificial Intelligence really is. As with the pretty much every single topic that has ever existed, there are <em>plenty</em> of different definitions on what AI really is.</p>

<p>You can consider AI to be a human-like robot that operates and thinks as a human, but you will be wrong. You can consider AI to be a computer with feelings, and you will, once again, be wrong.</p>

<p>So, lets start this article by defining AI as a hardware + software combination (or just a software) that takes the input data, processes it in some way that no human intelligence could ever be capable of doing, and then returns the output to the user. Now, you might argue with me that this definition does not represent AI and that it only represents what every single computer program is made for, but I think that you will be wrong.</p>

<p>We currently do not have any all-purpose AI solution. What this means is that every algorithm and every robot is built with the specific purpose in mind. Take it and put it in some other environment, the one that the programmers and/or engineers haven’t thought of while they were building it, and you got yourself a pretty useless piece of software (+ hardware in some cases).</p>

<p>To get back to the subject, I strongly think that AI is not something that <em>is going to</em> change the future. I think that it already has. It is only going to increase the way it changes us and the world around us following the Moore’s law.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Moore’s law is the observation that the power of the computer doubles approximately every two years.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now there are some different definitions of how long does it take to the computer power to double. Some say that this process lasts only a year, some say that lasts 18 months, and others say that it lasts for two years. The point is that the computer power is increasing constantly at a <em>very</em> fast rate.</p>

<h3 id="so-how-is-the-world-around-us-changed-with-the-ai">So, how is the world around us changed with the AI?</h3>

<p>First of all, we all got smartphones in our pockets. I know, you’re probably tired of hearing this, but todays low-end smartphones <em>are</em> more powerful than the supercomputers we had as recently as 20 years ago, and we can’t even properly compare the physical size of them (one of them being as big as a room and the other being small enough to fit in a pocket). So, lets take Siri for an example. She is powerful, not powerful enough as a “regular” personal assistant (and by regular I mean human), but she is getting better and better. Her biggest flaw definitely is the speech recognition, which is quite a challenging topic in AI. It is a fine example of AI that runs <em>from your phone</em>.</p>

<p>Next example: Google Search. Long time ago, Google stopped offering all around search results and started memorizing what we searched for in the past and started using it to predict the topics we’re interested in searching. As an example, as you might already know, I have hosted my blog for almost six months using my <a href="https://aleksandartodorovic.wordpress.com/">Wordpress.com domain</a>. After that, I have decided to ditch it and to start using my <a href="http://r3bl.github.io/">current domain</a> together with Jekyll blogging platform. After I’ve started searching for some Jekyll tweaks and themes, I kept finding Wordpress tweaks as my top results. This type of AI is not easily recognizable, the search results vary only a little, but it is happening and you are using AI every time you use Google’s search provider. Try looking up your name from two different devices (both running different Google accounts) and see it for yourself.</p>

<p>Next stop: Google Glass and Google’s self-driving vehicles. After that: that annoying Facebook algorithm that “predicts” people you should add to your friends based on your common interests, your location and with the interaction with your mutual friends. Face recognition? Of course, AI (and it is getting pretty good with it). YouTube video suggestions? Again, AI. Evernote tags? AI. Facebook timeline? AI. Cleverbot? (A pretty stupid use of) AI. Stock markets? We now have AI platforms that advises us which stocks should we buy and which stocks should we sell.</p>

<p>You see, everything we do online <em>is</em> starting to be enhanced by AI. That line is not going to decrease over time, it is only going to increase at an exponential rate (as seen in the picture I showed as an example below).</p>

<p><img src="http://www.regentsprep.org/regents/math/algebra/AE7/fixpic2.gif" alt="exponential growth" /></p>

<h3 id="so-what-could-we-expect-in-the-near-future">So, what could we expect in the near future?</h3>

<p>Ray Kurzweil is probably the biggest futurist alive. He has received 20 honorary doctorates and he has been awarded by three U.S. presidents. He published seven books, five of which have been national bestsellers. He already predicted some of our achievements and when they’re going to happen. He predicted that computers will be able to beat chess masters in (you guessed it) chess, that we will have WiFi broadly implemented across the world, that there will be self-driving vehicles reaching consumerism (OK, we still have a few years ahead of this, but does anyone really doubt it?), that we will find a way to project images right before our eyes… The list goes on and on. Following Moore’s law, he predicted even more amazing things in the next 25 years.</p>

<p>He predicts that we will be able to fight most of the known diseases by using nanobots. He predicts that the virtual reality is going to feel 100% real by the 2030s. He says that we will reach a point of singularity probably around 2029. He predicts that the line between the reality and the virtual reality is going to blur out.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Singularity is the hypothesis that accelerating progress in technologies will cause a runaway effect wherein artificial intelligence will exceed human intellectual capacity and control, thus radically changing civilization in an event called the singularity.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="will-ai-destoy-us">Will AI destoy us?</h3>

<p>This is probably the most misleading statement in the field of AI. And it is pretty simple to figure out why. We have tons of movies with scenarios in which we created something so powerful that it considered us just as a threat and destroyed us. Take <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2209764/">Transcendence (2014)</a> as an example (although it doesn’t blindly follow that pattern). But I don’t think that anyone who knows something about AI agrees with it. You see, for the machine to become intelligent, first we need to program it. And I don’t think that anyone with the capacity of creating the real AI is going to try to dominate the world in any way. Our biggest bet probably relies on some huge company like IBM or Google, and I don’t think that they’re going to make such an awful mistake. Most of the AI scientissts and futurists agree with me on that. After all, the goal of AI is not to kill every potential buyer out there. The goal of creating AI is to create something that will exceed human intelligence and help us to find some answers to the questions we’re struggling with for a very long time.</p>

    <p><img src="http://www.marksanborn.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/learning-priorities-Development.jpg" alt="image" /></p>

<p>Well, this was actually not a part of my goals for 2015, but it <em>is</em> something that I thought of in the meantime.</p>

<p>I love learning and I love dedicating my free time to learn something new. Currently, I’m really enjoying learning about artificial intelligence, which is definitely one of the most promising technology-related topics there is. I’m intrigued and amazed by every single new line that I read about it and I’m probably going to keep up with the learning of artificial intelligence for quite some time.</p>

<p>So, today, it got me wondered, why not pledge to learn something new every single day?</p>

<p>And I really mean <em>every</em>. <em>single</em>. <em>day</em>. No breaks, no vacations, no nothing. I love learning and I have developed a habit of learning something new at least once a week. So, why don’t I kick it up a notch?</p>

<p>Starting from today (well, actually, I have been learning something new for a few days in a row now), I’ve decided to learn something new every single day out of the topics I’m interested in. I’ve devoted my last month into getting quite a lot of books that are interesting to me, so now, I’m going to start reading them a day after day. One page a day is better than none.</p>

<p>I want to build a healthy habit that could help me throughout my career and this is the way of accomplishing it I’m completely comfortable with.</p>

<p>So, starting from today, you can expect me to push at least one commit to <a href="https://github.com/aleksandar-todorovic/notes/">my notes repository</a> every day. That repository already has over 5,000 words written in it and the list is only going to get bigger and bigger as I’m going to research as much interesting topics as possible.</p>

<p>During the weekends, I’m going to review my notes from the previous week, simplifying them and shortening them if needed. After I start to organize my time in an efficient way, I’m going to start to <a href="http://ejohn.org/blog/write-code-every-day/">write code every day</a>, and, in a couple of months, I should know much more than I know currently in a wide variety of topics.</p>

<p>I should emphasize that my goal is not to become an expert in a specific topic. My goal is to have a reasonable amount of knowledge in every single topic I can think of. My goal is to stop asking myself how something works. My goal is to start <em>learning</em> how something works on a daily basis.</p>

<p>Who knows, if I work <em>really</em> hard, I might even be able to get a summer internship in some company that I deeply admire.</p>

<p>At the end of the post, I’m going to share my short-term goals with the public, to make sure that I make them a reality and to get an even higher inspiration:</p>

  <li>Pass every subject from my first semester in the first half of February (two of them left, my finals are starting in five days).</li>
  <li>Start the coding challenge that I’ve mentioned before by the end of February.</li>
  <li>Pass every subject from my second semester by the end of the first half of April (again, only two of them left).</li>
  <li>Have a decent amount of knowledge in artificial intelligence by the end of May.</li>
  <li>Have a decent amount of proficiency in C / C++ / Vala by the end of June.</li>
</ul>

<p>I’m going to update this post every time I accomplish a goal I stated here by adding a check mark (✓) next to it. And, of course, every time I learn something interesting worthy of posting, I will put an update my blog.</p>

    <p>Počeo sam da sumnjam kada sam krenuo u prvi razred srednje škole. Išao sam u poprilično jedno-religijsku osnovnu školu, i poslije toga sam se preselio u Brčko, poznato kao jedan od rijetkih gradova gdje sve tri nacionalnosti iz BiH živi zajedno. U početku savršeno, kasnije noćna mora. Iako se ljudi prave da nema podjele, srednjoškolci jedne nacionalnosti idu u jedan kafić, srednjoškolci druge u drugi kafić, srednjoškolci treće vjere u treći kafić. I to je postalo sasvim normalno. Da se razumijemo, ne kažem da su svi posjetioci ta tri kafića koje pominjem bili te vjere, ali procenat je poprilično ogroman da bi se zanemario.</p>

<p>Odbijajući da se ograničim na to sa kojim ću se ljudima družiti na osnovu njihove religije, često sam bio kritikovan i odbacivan od “svojih” ljudi. Zbog te odbačenosti na neki način, počeo sam da dobijam averziju prema svojoj vjeri i u “hakerskom” duhu, krenuo sam da istražujem. Na jedan papir sam u dvije kolone napisao usporedbe o određenim shvatanjima iz Biblije sa znanstvenim zaključcima. Shvatio sam da se ne slažem sa mnogo stvari iz Biblije, i kao neko ko je zapravo pročitao Bibliju (budimo realni, većina vjernika je nikada i ne pročita), postao sam svjestan da ljudi citate uzimaju iz konteksta, uzimajući ono što im odgovara, odbacujući dijelove Biblije koji im ne odgovaraju. To je po meni bilo pogrešno. Ne možeš jedan dio svete knjige da poštuješ, drugi ne. Ili idi na sve, ili ne idi na ništa.</p>

<p>Presudan trenutak je za mene bio jedan sasvim običan dan kada sam gledao jedan od nastupa preminulog komičara George Carlin-a. Onda je došao ovaj dio, koji je bukvalno bio okidač u mom slučaju. Preko noći, prestao sam da ispitujem svoju religiju i odlučio da je odbacim. Proces “prelaska” je trajao čitavu moju srednju školu, a kada sam završio srednju školu, i taj proces je bio završen.</p>

<iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8r-e2NDSTuE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>Danas, skoro tri godine kasnije, trpim posljedice. Na popisu stanovništva u BiH, ispitivač je odbio da upiše Bosanac ateista kao moju nacionalnost i religiju. Nastala je svađa, i na kraju sam pod pritiskom od strane roditelja i popisivača ipak potpisao papir na kojem piše da sam Srbin pravoslavac, nešto čemu sam se strogo protivio u tom trenutku, i još uvijek se protivim.</p>

<p>Nedavno sam našao jednu prelijepu curu i zaljubio se. Prekinuli smo kada su njeni saznali moje ime i prezime, automatski misleći o meni da sam Srbin pravoslavac na osnovu imena, ni ne popričavši sa mnom i odbacujući svaku mogućnost da sam nešto drugačije od onoga šta moje ime predstavlja. Razlog zašto im moja (sada već bivša) cura nije rekla moje pravo opredjeljenje jeste zato što bi “bilo još gore” (pod navodnicima ne zato što se ne slažem sa rečenim, nego da stavim u konekst u kojem sam doživio te riječi).</p>

<p>Da se razumijemo, ovo nije prvi put da mi se to dogodilo i ovo je već četvrta ili peta veza koja se završila na potpuno isti način (opisan u pseudokodu koji će svako razumjeti):</p>

<pre><code>cura kaže roditeljima moje ime
povežu me sa nacijom i religijom
ukoliko je moja nacija drugačija od njene
    pritišću je na to da odustane
    ukoliko ona još uvijek zavisi od njih
        popušta pri pritisku.
</code></pre>

<p>Samo, ova me je do sada na neki način najviše pogodila, te za mene ostavila potrebu da se na neki način “istresem”, odlučio sam se za ovaj način.</p>

<p>Dalje, posao. Primljen u kafić da konobarišem, kontao dobro će mi doći malo para sa strane, nema puno posla pa se mogu fokusirati na fakultet kada nema gostiju. Tokom godina, počevši od srednje pa do sada, naučio sam da se ne obazirem na imena. U početku mi je bilo čudno, vrlo čudno upoznati osobu koja se zove Emir, Aldina, Amar, Medina, Hajrudin, Albin, Edita i slično. U ovo vrijeme, počeo sam da ogluvljujem na imena, ne identifikovajući ih odma kao naciju i vjeru, nego isključivo kao osobu sa možda potpuno drugačijom pričom. Na tom poslu nisam ni primjetio da su su svi zaposleni, kao i šefovi i gosti koji dolaze tamo, zapravo svi jedne vjere. U prvoj prilici kada je to gazda napomenuo govoreći o konkurentnom kafiću kako ne može da vjeruje da neke osobe radije idu tamo nego ovdje (jer pobogu, tamo je gazda Bošnjak!), počeo sam da se oglušujem na naredbe i ubrzo dao otkaz, na pomalo nepredviđen način, ali dokazao sam da sa takvim osobama jednostavno ne mogu “poslovati” (malo grub termin uzimajući u obzir (ne)ozbiljnost ovog posla).</p>

<p>Danas se distanciram od ljudi koje smatram lošim, bez obzira na naciju i vjeru. Nisam ograničen nijednom “svetom knjigom”, te uživam u tome da čitam različite teorije na ovu temu, bez straha da ću zbog svoje radoznalosti biti mučen “do kraja vremena” (šta god taj pojam predstavljao). Imam dosta otvoreno društvo od 20ak ljudi koje jednostavno boli k… za religiju i naciju, te ih većina ili ima sumnje ili u potpunosti odbacuje svoju religiju, ipak poštujući one koji vjeruju.</p>

<p>Još jedna stvar koju mi je omogućio ovaj pritisak na mene od strane “mojih” i “onih ostalih” jeste taj da se prestanem toliko brinuti o mislima ostalih (u koje sada za mene spadaju i “moji” i “tuđi”) i da se fokusiram na lični uspjeh. Dok ja radim na sebi, oni pričaju o meni, stagnirajući na potpuno istom mjestu iz dana u dan.</p>

<p>Poenta je: Uspio sam se osloboditi tih okova koje mi je društvo nametalo. Postao sam slobodan čovjek, istražujući i fokusirajući se na svoje znanje, odbijajući da prihvatim bilo kakvo ograničenje koje mi neko postavi. Doživljavam neke posljedice sa vremena na vrijeme zbog toga, međutim nema te posljedice koja može da nadmaši sve dobro što mi je sloboda donijela. Počevši sa vjerom, prešao sam i na druge stvari u životu, tako da sam sada uspješno izgradio svoje lično ja, koje je potpuno drugačije od društveno prihvatljive norme.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Društvena norma je biti pripadnik neke vjere =&gt; ja sam ateista.</li>
  <li>Društvena norma je slušati narodnjake =&gt; ja partijam vikendima i na neki način se i bavim elektronskom muzikom.</li>
  <li>Društvena norma je biti ograničen na Windows =&gt; ja sam zakleti Linux-aš.</li>
</ul>

<p>Dakle, za mene je odbacivanje vjere bio jedan (a i najvažniji) od koraka koje sam prešao pri kreiranju svoje ličnosti, odbacujući ono što drugi žele od mene i fokusirajući se na to šta ja želim od sebe.</p>

<p>Na kraju, želim da citiram sam sebe (koliko god to glupo zvučalo) tako što što ću navesti jednu rečenicu koju obožavam da izgovaram:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Možda nisam najljepši, možda nisam najzgodniji, možda imam svoje poroke, međutim, imam mozak i znam kako da ga iskoristim.</p>
</blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Wordpress was a great platform for the beginning of my blogging experience. The simplicity needed for the creation and maintaining of the Wordpress blog is amazing. It literally took me 10 minutes from the creation of my blog to my first post. But, a few days ago, I’ve decided that it is time for me to switch to something more powerful. I’ve decided to switch to Jekyll blogging platform.</p>

<h3 id="why-have-i-chosen-github--jekyll-as-my-new-platform">Why have I chosen GitHub + Jekyll as my new platform?</h3>

<p>Well, first of all, my PHP knowledge is <em>very</em> limited. I have always considered PHP to be the weakest spot in my education. And, on top of that, I’m not that comfortable with databases for now. Jekyll has allowed me to run a completely self-maintained blog without using any PHP or MySQL.</p>

<h3 id="using-this-combo-is-going-to-boost-my-github-profile-and-my-git-knowledge">Using this combo is going to boost my GitHub profile <em>and</em> my Git knowledge</h3>

<p>Because of the excellent Jekyll integration with GitHub pages, maintaining a blog using Jekyll is going to force me to use GitHub even more than I have used it so far. And I think that is great. By doing so, I’m going to visit GitHub more often, which will boost my desire to hack and program new things (<a href="https://github.com/personal-assistant/pa-wiki#personal-assistant">this</a> is the newest project I’m planing on making a reality).</p>

<p>It will also boost my GitHub profile in the search results, which is something I desperately need to do. While Google-ing my full name, I found out that there’s <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0865390/">an actor</a>, <a href="http://aleksandartodorovic.com/">a photographer</a> and a war criminal with the same name as mine. You can imagine the surprise of my future employer if he sees my name associated with a term such as a war criminal.</p>

<h3 id="i-love-every-single-product-that-github-developed-over-the-years">I love every single product that GitHub developed over the years</h3>

<p>Lets be honest, <a href="http://r3bl.github.io/en/why-github-is-my-favorite-company/">GitHub is my favorite company</a> and I love every single feature they’ve developed over the years. I love their tight integration with Git,  their pages, their Gists, their <a href="http://atom.io/">Atom text editor</a> and their <a href="https://education.github.com/pack">Student Developer Pack</a> (even though my request is still in the verification process).</p>

<h3 id="markdown-has-become-my-favorite-markup-language">Markdown has become my favorite markup language</h3>

<p>Ever since I’ve started using GitHub more regularly, I’m amazed by the simplicity behind Markdown. I’m using it to type everything from by blog posts to my collage papers and essays. Now, to be honest, I’ve written most of my posts using Markdown even back when in my Wordpress days, but Jekyll allows me to update my blog in an incredibly simple way. I just have to write my post inside of a new Markdown file, update my repository and that’s it. I don’t even have to open Firefox to post something.</p>

<h3 id="an-option-to-choose-a-commenting-platform">An option to choose a commenting platform</h3>

<p>Lets be honest, if you need comments on your website, Disqus is the way to go. Most of the sites I’m visiting are using it, and I see no reason of why I should choose anything else.</p>

<h3 id="i-love-having-the-full-control-over-my-blog">I love having the full control over my blog</h3>

<p>Worpress.com is a free platform and as such it does have some advantages and some limitations. Even though I loved the simplicity of some feature (like a Wordpress stats feature), I hated the way I was limited in the customization of my blog. Using this combination, I have no limitation that I’m uncomfortable with. I can customize my blog in any way I want and it feels great! Every Jekyll customization, every theme and every plugin I ran into were completely free (as in both speech <em>and</em> beer) and because of that I can customize every single aspect of them as I wish.</p>

<h3 id="so-how-will-i-make-the-transition-happen">So, how will I make the transition happen?</h3>

<p>Now this is a tricky one. I <em>have</em> decided that I’m going to be using this combination permanently, but I <em>do</em> have a lot of work to do before making the final switch.</p>

<p>First of all, there are still some parts of this excellent <a href="https://mmistakes.github.io/hpstr-jekyll-theme/">HPSTR Jekyll theme</a> that I haven’t customized properly (or <em>at all</em>). This is why I’m regularly updating a <a href="https://github.com/r3bl/r3bl.github.io/blob/master/TODO.md">TODO.md</a> file to remind myself of what still needs to be done.</p>

<p>So, if you like my blog, I encourage you to go through that TODO.md file and to report any issues that I haven’t noticed inside of that file <a href="https://github.com/r3bl/r3bl.github.io/issues">here</a>.</p>

<p>In the meantime, I’m going to post on <a href="https://aleksandartodorovic.wordpress.com/">my old platform</a> and <a href="http://r3bl.github.io/">my new platform</a> until I’m completely satisfied with the switch. I have also started posting my most interesting articles on Medium not too long ago, so you might want to <a href="https://medium.com/@r3bl">check that out</a> as well.</p>

<p>You can expect some great new things like SSL support, my own domain and a fully customized home page in the near future. And, in the spirit of open source software, every single line of code <a href="https://github.com/r3bl/r3bl.github.io">is available</a> for you to fork and use in your project in any way you want.</p>
