  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>What does it mean to be an open source advocate? Can I really make a difference? How do I do that? There are so many questions about the Open Source Advocacy and, surprisingly, so little answers available.</p>

<h2 id="why-do-i-call-myself-an-open-source-advocate">Why do I call myself an Open Source Advocate?</h2>

<p>I’ve been calling myself an Open Source Advocate for a while now. Not because I consider myself as an influential person, but because I can’t find a more suitable title that covers what I do in my free time.</p>

<p>I’m not really an open source programmer. Although I know the syntax of five or six programming languages, I do not consider myself as an expert in neither of them (for now). That’s why my coding contributions are pretty limited so far.</p>

<p>I’m not a designer neither. I just don’t see myself as one. I like to use well-designed programs and web services, but I’m not familiar nor interested in the process of making a well designed program / web service.</p>

<p>Now what I’m good at is actually testing the software, reporting bugs, trying out new features and tools, translating projects to my native language, communicating with the people representing various open source projects and, most of all, actually talking about the open source software on my blog.</p>

<p>And that’s where I found myself. That’s the beauty of open source. There’s something to do for everyone.</p>

<p>If you want to contribute to an open source project, you can. No matter what’s your area of expertise. All you need is your willingness to do something. To make a change… After all, <a href="https://r3bl.github.io/en/every-one-of-us-changes-the-world-in-one-way-or-another/">we’re all shaping the world</a> with every single step we take.</p>

    <p>Have you ever seen movies or read books about Harry Potter? If you did, then you might be familiar with the term Marauder’s Map. If you’re not a Harry Potter fan or the term doesn’t ring a bell, here’s a one minute video that will explain the basic concept to you:</p>

<iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WVBha-QUUCE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>So basically, in Harry Potter’s world, Marauder’s map is a map that allows you to see the exact location of every single person inside of Hogwarts at any given point of time. Handy, isn’t it? Well, thanks to the technology and Facebook’s amazing features, this map has now become a reality.</p>

<h2 id="i-present-to-you-the-real-marauders-map">I present to you: The real Marauder’s map!</h2>

<p><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/marauders-map/mliofombcghaamgjkmmmmlepkiacdhkh">Marauder’s map</a> is a Chrome extension that shows you the map with the exact location of your friends (we’ll talk about how this works in a minute).</p>

<p>Simply install it, navigate to <code>https://www.facebook.com/messages/</code>, select a conversation with the friend whose location you want to see and their location will “magically” appear on the map.</p>

<p>It doesn’t even have to be an individual friend. This extension works with group conversations too! It even works with the people you don’t have in your list of friends.</p>

<p><img src="https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/800/1*UjOiHrFnQhU25xcOMcPU7A.png" alt="image" /></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What the hell? How does this work?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Every time you send a message using a Messenger app, with that message you’re also sending your exact GPS location to the receiver of the message <em>by default</em>. Finding out the ways to exploit this data is a fairly simple process, isn’t it?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I don’t want other people spying on me! How do I fight this thing?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Simply open the settings of your Messenger app and turn off the location sending (again, this is on <em>by default</em>).</p>

<h2 id="credits-to-the-author">Credits to the author</h2>

<p>The author of this Chrome extension is <a href="arankhanna.com">Aran Khanna</a>. He’s written a <a href="https://medium.com/@arankhanna/stalking-your-friends-with-facebook-messenger-9da8820bd27d">blog post</a> explaining his concerns and motives behind this discovery. I highly suggest you to read it if you want to learn more about this. The extension is released under the MIT license (yay open source!) and it is hosted <a href="https://github.com/arank/marauders-map">on GitHub</a>.</p>

<h2 id="more-facebook-hacks">More Facebook hacks?</h2>

    <p>You’re probably wondering what the hell is a post about terrorism doing on a primarily IT oriented blog? Well, I got interested in the term cyber terrorism. I want learn more about this term: is cyber terrorism possible, how to fight against it, etc.</p>

<p>To get an answer to questions on cyber terrorism, I wanted to look at the basics: what terrorism is and is it a real threat. So, I visited a couple of sites that I usually use to learn something new and I found out about the course called <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/terrorism">Terrorism and Counterterrorism: Comparing Theory and Practice</a> offered by the <a href="http://leiden.edu/">University of Leiden</a>. I have to say that my recent <a href="https://r3bl.github.io/en/evs-netherlands-experience/">volunteering experience</a> had a huge impact of selecting this course over any other way of studying this subject. Seriously, the city Leiden is freaking beautiful!</p>

<p>I finished three weeks of the course in the last three days and now that I have <em>some</em> prior knowledge about the subject, I wanted to share with you some common assumptions about the terrorism and to clarify whether are they true or not.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.nationofchange.org/2015/wp-content/uploads/terrorism12115.jpg" alt="terrorism" /></p>

<h2 id="what-is-terrorism">What is terrorism?</h2>

<p>This might be the biggest question in the field of terrorism to answer. Terrorism is a <em>highly</em> subjective term. We do not have a widely accepted definition of this term and this has proven to be one of the major obstacles in actually fighting against terrorism. After all, how can you fight against something if you cannot properly define it?</p>

<p>There are different reasons why this term is hard to define, but because I want this article to be short and straightforward, I’ll skip writing about those reasons now.</p>

<p>For the sake of actually writing the rest of this article, I will borrow the definition from the Oxford dictionary, mostly because this definition seems like the easiest one to understand:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Terrorism is the unofficial use of violence and intimidation in the pursuit of political aims.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="assumption-no1-terrorism-is-caused-by-poverty">Assumption no.1: Terrorism is caused by poverty</h3>

<p>This is a myth. Nothing else. There are lots of examples of wealthy terrorists. There are no direct links between terrorism and poverty what so ever. It is true in some individual cases, but poverty is <em>not</em> the root cause of the problem.</p>

<p>Why is it important to beat this assumption? Well, if this assumption was true, then we would have a pretty straightforward way of actually fighting against terrorism. Terrorism would be yet just another reason on why we should fight against the poverty in the third world countries. Unfortunately, this is not the case.</p>

<h3 id="assumption-no2-terrorists-are-crazy">Assumption no.2: Terrorists are crazy</h3>

<p>In this assumption, we again face the problem of actually defining the terms such as “crazy” and “insane”. Both of those terms are highly subjective.</p>

<p>It is easy to assume why we assume that the terrorists are crazy. After all, it is hard for us to realize that the rational person (someone just like you and me) could ever do such a thing as killing (mostly) innocent people to achieve certain goals.</p>

<p>However, I do have to disappoint you. Although this assumption is <em>not</em> a myth, it <em>is</em> false. Terrorism is a rational behavior making terrorists rational actors that kill to achieve certain political goals.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“They [terrorists] are not depressed and not severely emotionally disturbed, nor are they crazed fanatics. In fact, terrorist groups and organizations regularly weed out emotionally unstable individuals. They represent, after all, a security risk.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why is it important to debunk this myth? Well, if it <em>were</em> true, and if the terrorists <em>were</em> really crazy, then there would be no point in fighting against terrorism. We could not investigate their motives. It would mean that they’re simply crazy. And I think that you would all agree when I say that labeling crazy persons as potential terrorists and discriminating them because of that would not be really democratic.</p>

<h3 id="assumption-no3-terrorism-is-increasingly-lethal">Assumption no.3: Terrorism is increasingly lethal</h3>

<p>Here, we will have to divide this assumption in two pieces:</p>

<ol>
  <li>There are more terrorist attacks than ever before.</li>
  <li>Terrorist attacks kill more people than ever before.</li>
</ol>

<p>If this assumption proves to be true, then it is easy to say that we have to devote more means to fight against terrorism than ever before. If this assumption proves to be false, then it is easy to say that it might be better to spend more money and resources on something else.</p>

<p>So, is the terrorism becoming more lethal? Well, yes and no. The worldwide number of terrorist victims worldwide has its ups and downs over the years. The number of victims has not increased after 9/11 as many people assume it did. However, the number of victims per attack has increased.</p>

<p>We can say that this assumption is partially true. Number of victims per attack <em>is</em> increasing, but the worldwide number of terrorist victims per year is <em>not</em> going straight upwards.</p>

<h3 id="assumption-no4-terrorism-is-predominately-anti-western">Assumption no.4: Terrorism is predominately anti-western</h3>

<p>If we mistakenly assume that this is true, we could make anti-western groups even bigger than ever before, we could increase the struggle between Christianity and Islam and this could lead to generalization and stereotyping against certain groups.</p>

<p>As you can see, this assumption is highly delicate. However, it is not really true. We <em>do</em> have a higher number of threats against the western world than ever before. But lets look at the actual number of victims. Between 2005 and 2010, somewhere between 82 and 97% of <em>all</em> terrorist victims worldwide were actually Muslim. Most of them were victims of separatist groups in places where Muslim population is a majority, places like Pakistan, Afghanistan, some central parts of Africa and southern parts of Russia.</p>

<p>As a conclusion, the number of anti-western threats is increasing, but the majority of the actual victims of terrorist attacks are not located in the western parts of the world.</p>

<h3 id="assumption-no5-terrorism-is-successful">Assumption no.5: Terrorism is successful</h3>

<p>To fight against this assumption, first we have to define what makes a terrorist attack successful. Is it the number of casualties? Is it the ability to spread fear? Is it the number of cases where terrorists managed to fulfill their political goals?</p>

<p>It is surprising to know that <em>only</em> 7% of the time terrorists actually managed to accomplish their political goals. Of those 7%, majority of the attacks were conducted against military victims, not civilians. In fact, if we look at the stats, we can safely say that if the terrorist group attacks civilians, their chances of actually achieving their political goals are negligible.</p>

<p>But are terrorists actually succeeding is spreading fear? Surprisingly, the number of people that are worried about themselves or the members of their family actually becoming victims of the terrorist attack is not increasing in the western world. It remains pretty much the same now as it did prior to 9/11. Of course, it is true to say that this number was peaking right after the 9/11 attack. But, apart from that, nothing is changing. Somewhere between 25 and 42% of people in the U.S. are concerned of becoming the victims of a terrorist attack. The number is way lower in European countries. The situation was pretty much the same prior to 9/11.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Terrorists often succeed tactically and thereby gain attention, cause alarms, and attract recruits. But their struggle has brought them no success measured against their own stated goals. In that sense, terrorism has failed, but the phenomenon of terrorism continues.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="so-is-the-fear-justified">So, is the fear justified?</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Between 1981 and 1986, more news stories were broadcast [by the three TV networks, ABC, CBS, and NBC] on terrorism than on poverty, unemployment, racial inequality, and crime combined.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The propaganda against terrorism is strong. It is stronger than ever. Terrorism, on the other side, is not. Terrorism is a threat, but it is not as big of a threat as medias, politicians, and public figures make it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The main education of the public on terrorism is via the media and frequent misuse of the word will result in it becoming a meaningless cliché.”</p>
</blockquote>

    <p>If you have read any of my previous posts, you probably know that I’m a huge workaholic. I like to <a href="https://r3bl.github.io/en/learn-something-every-day/">learn something new every single day</a>, I like to explore different things and I’m a huge fan of reading books and listening to music.</p>

<p>Now, seven days after my <a href="https://r3bl.github.io/en/evs-netherlands-experience/">volunteering in the Netherlands</a> has finished, I had enough time to look at my life from a different perspective, to find my weaknesses, my advantages, my knowledge gaps etc.</p>

<p>Before my trip, everything in my life was digital. My favorite songs were on my computer, I <a href="https://r3bl.github.io/en/quitting-djing/">DJ-ed for a couple of years</a> using nothing more than my AKAI controller bundled with my favorite DJ-ing software and <em>a lot</em> of digital songs. I’ve read a lot of books from my Kindle account without paying a dime (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/freeebooks">hint</a>) and I had written every single post on this blog using <a href="http://r3bl.github.io/en/why-github-is-my-favorite-company/#atom-text-editor">my favorite text editor</a>. Now, after the trip, the things have kind of changed.</p>

<p>During the trip, I had enough time <em>and</em> money to go to the <a href="http://www.abc.nl/">American Book Center</a> and buy some books, to walk around Amsterdam and to find a couple of stores specialized in selling vinyls and I got a neat notebook designed for students to help me in my future studies! Now, I feel like lots of things have changed.</p>

<h2 id="books">Books</h2>

<p>I’ve started to feel a special bond with the books that I have purchased during my trip. I posses six new books, each of them in their original English editions and I’m starting to fill up my work desk with more than just gadgets.</p>

<p>Although I have possessed three of them already in their digital form (khm, khm, ilegally), I haven’t read neither of them, partially because I didn’t have enough time to do so and partially because I have a huge variety of books that I can get my hands on in a matter of seconds.</p>

<p>Because of that, I often abandon my reading of a certain book and start to read a new one. After that, I just abandon that book and move to some new book. Pretty soon, I have like 10 books that I had started reading but never finished them. Oh, and one more reason for this might be the fact that reading a book on a laptop <em>is</em> a pain in the ass, regardless of the fact that I find it easier than most of the people I know.</p>

<p>Now, the books are right here, on my work desk, filling up that limited amount of space and reminding me that I have to read them. Because of that, my desire for reading is bigger than ever and I am trying to find enough time to read them.</p>

<p>I am no longer obligated to keep an eye of the battery on my laptop while I’m reading a book. I don’t have to struggle with the sun because it is too strong to see my screen clearly. That’s why my bond to them is much stronger than to any book I have laying around on my hard drive. And <a href="https://medium.com/gone/how-this-tokyo-bookstore-made-me-fall-back-in-love-with-print-5674a68d6e59">this exellect article</a> helped me to appreciate them even more!</p>

<p>I have purchased two of the classics: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/573607.The_God_Delusion">The God Delusion</a> by Richard Dawkins and <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22501993-alan-turing">Alan Turing: The Enigma</a> by Andrew Hodges (I had already shared my admiration for Alan Turing’s work <a href="https://r3bl.github.io/en/alan-turing/">here</a>). These two books will, without a doubt, always have a special place on my work desk and in my heart.</p>

<p>Of course, after reading these six books, it will be tough to find printed versions of new books to add to my collection, especially because I’m not really a fan reading books translated to my language, but I will have to find a convenient way to get my hands on them.</p>

<h2 id="vinyls">Vinyls</h2>

<p>If somebody asks me to make a list of my favorite songs, I can guarantee you that none of the songs from Ray Charles or Tom Jones will make it to the list. Well, except this remix:</p>

<iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7H0g1euywnk" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>But that doesn’t stop me for being exceptionally proud of myself for being the new owner of their vinyls. Although I don’t have a vinyl player (or know anyone who has a functioning one), there’s this special bond that I feel right now to those timeless classics such as <em>Hit The Road Jack</em>, <em>It’s Not Unusuall</em> etc. I feel more connected to the history of music. Don’t ask me why because I’m not able to explain it. Maybe I should ask my new friend that I met during my volunteering that has a degree in psychology, huh?</p>

<h2 id="posting-on-my-blog">Posting on my blog</h2>

<p>Although I’m still writing my blog posts using Atom, that notebook I got really helps me to feel inspired about writing. I find it convenient to share my ideas for new posts in it and to write a short breakdown of what my posts should look like. I really do hope that I will take my writing to the next level because of it.</p>

<h2 id="productivity">Productivity</h2>

<p>Now, as for the productivity, I had now returned to my previous habits, but now I realized that although I considered myself as a productive person, I have spent most the 24 hours doing absolutely nothing productive. During the trip, every day was carefully planned and I had managed to accomplish a lot in just one day. Now, I appreciate more each new day and I’m trying to push my limits of what I can accomplish in a single day.</p>

<p>The trip did, without any doubts, changed my perspective of the world. I will forever be grateful to the people that allowed me that opportunity and it is kind of hard to return to my regular life after this trip. But, I will do my best to make an intellectual progress every single day. Hopefully, in a year or two, I will get a chance to get back to that wonderful country and this time for a longer period of time.</p>

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>One month is a short amount of time. But, if you play your cards right, one month can change your perspective on life. And this is exactly what happened to me in the last month.</p>

<h2 id="evs-looking-for-future-springbos-2015">EVS Looking For Future (Springbos 2015)</h2>

<p>I’ve spent the last month in the beautiful county in the western part of Europe called the Netherlands. I stayed in a city called Rijswijk (right next to Den Haag) where I joined seven more short term volunteers.</p>

<p>We represented eight different countries: <strong>Spain</strong> (two short term volunteers, one long term volunteer and one mentor), <strong>Austria</strong> (one short term and one long term volunteer), <strong>Ukraine</strong> (one short term volunteer), <strong>Georgia</strong> (one short term volunteer), <strong>Italy</strong> (one short term volunteer), <strong>Germany</strong> (one long term volunteer), <strong>Slovakia</strong> (one long term volunteer), and of course, <strong>Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina</strong> (two short term volunteers and one long term volunteer). To make things a bit more interesting, we had two coordinators, one from <strong>India</strong> and one from <strong>Belgium</strong> and two mentors from <strong>Indonesia</strong>.</p>

<p>Now that’s a <em>huge</em> cultural clash. Apart from two Spanish guys that knew each other, nobody else had ever met anyone from this group before. We were complete strangers to each other on the first day, but yet we managed to become friends by the end of our journey together.</p>

<h2 id="so-what-did-we-do-in-the-netherlands">So, what did we do in the Netherlands?</h2>

<p>We helped <a href="http://donboscorijswijk.nl/">Don Bosco</a> Youth Center in Rijswijk to create a fresh and interesting program for the children. We worked with the kids for five days a week, we collected 3000€ for the homeless children in Bolivia during the Kingsday (national holiday in the Netherlands), we organized a three day long festival for 300 children that we called Fruitbos, we worked with homeless people in Amsterdam and a whole lot more. Not bad for one month, right?</p>

<p>We had different activities almost every single day and we did our best to contribute to the whole community in Rijswijk and Amsterdam by working with the youngest generations.</p>

<p>We changed each other’s perspective and we got to know different cultures in a way that otherwise would not be possible in such a short amount of time. Now that we are back to our countries, we will do our best to change our local communities in a similar way.</p>

<h2 id="what-did-i-get-from-this-experience">What did I get from this experience?</h2>

<p>The Netherlands is without a doubt the most liberal country in Europe. LGBT community is well accepted in this country, marihuana is legal[1] and prostitution is considered as nothing more than a regular job over there.</p>

<p>People don’t care where are you from, what religion you believe (or not believe) in, which color you are or whether you are a heterosexual or not. It is a country that fits my ideals perfectly and it was a real pleasure to live there for a month.</p>

<p>The Netherlands has an excellent public transport, which allowed me to visit every interesting city or place I wanted to visit in an hour or two. This allowed me to visit a lot of beautiful cities like Rotterdam, Den Haag, Delft, Leiden and Groningen cheaply and quickly. The traveler inside of me was very satisfied because of this.</p>

<p>I got a lot of connections from all over Europe and I experienced a climate that is a lot different than in my home country. I was able to listen to some of my favorite international DJs and producers. I experienced how it feels like to live in a developed country. I improved my English skills, learned a bit of Dutch and even a bit of Spanish. The list of accomplishments just goes on and on.</p>

<h2 id="what-will-be-my-next-step-now">What will be my next step now?</h2>

<p>After this wonderful experience, I’m going to try to work more closely with my youth organization. I’m going to continue studying towards my Bachelor degree and after it, I’m seriously going to consider applying for a Master degree in the Netherlands or finding an internship over there.</p>

<p>This has been my first Dutch experience, but I guarantee you, it won’t be my last. Seriously, I’m in love with this country!</p>

<h2 id="in-the-end">In the end…</h2>

<p>In the end, I wanted to say thank you to all of the volunteers that joined me from all over the Europe, to Dutch volunteers that helped us to feel at home, to students with whom we shared our accommodation, to the coordinators of Don Bosco Youth Center in the Netherlands and to Svitac Youth Center in my own city.</p>

<p>Thank you for this wonderful opportunity. You’ve made this month an unforgettable one for me. It was a real pleasure working with you guys and I do hope that this will not be the last time we meet each other.</p>

<p>[1] Correction: After I did some research, I found out that marihuana is <em>not</em> legal in the Netherlands. It is just tolerated, which means that you are allowed to buy and posses a small amount of it without the consequences. As it turns out, Dutch politicians are trying to make the distribution of marihuana products as tough as possible.</p>
