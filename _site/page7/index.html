    <p>As I’ve already said <a href="https://aleksandartodorovic.wordpress.com/2014/11/13/facebook-hack-no1/">in my previous post</a>, In this blog post series I’m going to post about some useful Facebook “hacks” that you can do without ever leaving Facebook at all. I will <em>not</em> be using any external software, website or something similar while posting about this topic.</p>

<p>You have some mobile numbers but you don’t know who’s behind them? Well, Facebook automatically allows you to search users by their mobile number, so all you have to do is to enter that phone number in Facebook’s search. There is absolutely no option for you to disable that what so ever.</p>

<p>It’s a lot easier to find someone if you have them as your friends, you’ll get a lot more exact information that way, because the default privacy setting for this is limited to friends only. You can also do this with an email address.</p>

<p><strong>A fun project</strong>: Create an Android/iPhone/Windows Phone/FirefoxOS application. When someone unknown number calls you, the application opens up Facebook and enters that mobile number in Facebook’s search and displays the top result to you, so you know who’s calling you even if you don’t have them inside your address book.</p>

<p>If you want to make this kind of application, please do let me know. I’m willing to use it and I’m willing to share it on my blog. I’m just lazy as fuck, so I won’t be creating that application any time soon.</p>

    <p>In this blog post series I’m going to post about some useful Facebook “hacks” that you can do without ever leaving Facebook at all. I will <em>not</em> be using any external software, website or something similar while posting about this.</p>

<p>Want to see who checks your profile the most, reads your stories and stuff like that? Well, Facebook automatically adds some points to an account for stuff like that and you can check out who’s currently your biggest “stalker” by following the description described here. I recommend you to use Firefox, it’s a lot easier to do this in Firefox than it is in Chrome.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Open up your Facebook’s homepage.</li>
  <li>Ctrl + U.</li>
  <li>Ctrl + F. Type InitialChatFriendsList in the find bar.</li>
  <li>After that string you’ll see a long number inside “” that ends with -2. Copy that number <em>without</em> -2 in the end.</li>
  <li>Go to https://www.facebook.com/<em>pastethatnumberhere</em></li>
  <li>Voila!</li>
</ol>

<p>If you’re using Chrome, Ctrl + F in the page inspector does not work as you’d expected it to work so my suggestion is to copy the entire page source to your favorite text editor and search from there.</p>

    <p>I feel pretty cyberpunk-ish lately so I’ve decided to change the whole look of three most important things to me: my blog, my Twitter account and my desktop.</p>

<p>I’m really feeling this concept art by a great artist called <a href="http://andreewallin.com/">Andree Wallin</a>. The art I like the most is called <a href="http://andreewallin.deviantart.com/art/Headphones-346542540">Headphones</a> so I’ve decided to use it as my main inspiration for the design. So this is how my desktop looks like right now:</p>

<p><a href="https://aleksandartodorovic.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/screenshot-from-2014-11-12-022234.png"><img src="https://aleksandartodorovic.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/screenshot-from-2014-11-12-022234.png?w=300" alt="Screenshot from 2014-11-12 02:22:34" /></a> <a href="https://aleksandartodorovic.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/screenshot-from-2014-11-12-022237.png"><img src="https://aleksandartodorovic.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/screenshot-from-2014-11-12-022237.png?w=300" alt="Screenshot from 2014-11-12 02:22:37" /></a></p>

<p>So what I did is I changed the background and then started to edit my Gtk theme and <a href="http://speedracker.deviantart.com/art/Purple-Rain-Conky-485091413">Purple Rain</a> Conky configuration file. I did loose a couple of hours doing that, but I’m pretty satisfied with it right now and I’m getting a lot of positive feedback all over Google+ and Reddit for it.</p>

<p>Next thing I freshened up the design of my blog. So I’ve changed the theme and customized it a little. Hope this design works better for you. If not, contact me of course.</p>

<p>My Twitter is also re-designed, which means I basically only changed my avatar, header photo and the colour scheme, so I don’t have a lot to talk about that.</p>

<p>Oh, and the <a href="https://aleksandartodorovic.wordpress.com/2014/11/11/elementary-os-bosnian-language/">translation of elementary OS</a> is going great! Although, I have to admit that I’m not a huge fan of Launchpad as a tool for the translation of such a big project.</p>

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>So, apart from writing my first semi-professional paper (which I wrote about – although in Bosnian - <a href="https://aleksandartodorovic.wordpress.com/2014/10/28/da-li-su-dobri-muzicki-producenti-ujedno-i-dobri-psiholozi-eksperiment/">here</a>) and organizing a contest on my blog where you could win a couple of Office 365 licenses for free, I started to fall in love into programming again. It’s been a couple of months since I programmed <em>anything</em>.</p>

<p>The last project I’ve been working on is working, but it has a hell of a lot of bugs. It’s called Sensitive Data Grabber and I’ve already written about it on my blog <a href="https://aleksandartodorovic.wordpress.com/2014/08/03/sensitive-data-grabber-project/">here</a>. So, why ain’t I finishing it?</p>

<p>Well, the thing is that I’ve created that project using Visual Basic inside Visual Studio. You probably know that this kind of environment is Windows-specific. I’ve been spending most of my time lately using Linux as my primary operating system. I’ve found my perfect distribution and it’s called elementary OS (I already covered the reasons why <a href="https://aleksandartodorovic.wordpress.com/2014/10/16/elementary-os-savrsena-distribucija-za-mene/">here</a> - again, in Bosnian language).</p>

<p>Now, because I don’t have enough knowledge in any programming language that can be run in my perfect distribution, I’m still adjusting. While I’m doing that, I’ve decided that I want to do <em>something</em> for the elementary community <em>before</em> I’m good enough to program some apps. Because of that, I’ve decided to start translating elementary OS to Bosnian language.</p>

<p>I’m not just getting started, I’ve already finished translating a lot of elementary-related projects. Now I only have seven (out of 37) projects left. That’s a little more than 2.5k strings to translate. It does seem like a lot, but I’m pretty confident that I will be able to finish that by the end of the year. Most of the operating system is already translated. By the time I finish it, I’ll probably be able to program some useful apps and then I’ll start to publish them using my own ppa.</p>

<p>I feel very optimistic right now. As the narrator says in the end of this great video:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I don’t know why, but.. I feel very excited about the future. Anything is possible now.</p>
</blockquote>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mp-IZEFqrG0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>

<p>The translation of elementary OS is almost over! Only a couple of programs until you can use elementary OS without any problems if you’re familiar with Bosnian language!</p>

    <p>A few days back I published <a href="https://aleksandartodorovic.wordpress.com/2014/10/30/get-free-office365-license/">this article </a>where I created a small giveaway, two Office 365 licenses for two of the best short stories I get.</p>

<p>Now, it’s time for me to declare winners. Both of the winners are from reddit’s <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace">PC Master Race subreddit</a> and both of them had written some great short stories about Gaben’s road to success! The winners are: [/u/Stannis<em>](https://www.reddit.com/user/Stannis</em>) and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/hobbit9797">/u/hobbit9797</a>. Thanks to everyone for their participation! This post will be updated once I get in contact with winners with a screenshot as a proof that this contest was not a scam in any way.</p>

<p>In the end of the post, I’m sharing the stories in their original form.</p>

<p><strong>A story from /u/Stannis_:</strong></p>

<p>Many years ago, before the days of the Steam, there lived a peasant, his daily routine was to come home from school, play CoD and have intercourse with mothers around the world, then one day while watching some video about the Xbox one announcement he spotted something on the side bar, slowly his cursor moved to the right like a lion hunting its prey, it hovered over the title, “how to build a gaming PC”, he seldom viewed anything about PC’s, with wonders flowing through his mind he pressed on the LMB.</p>

<p>He was amazed, the idea of being able to play Skyrim in 1920x1080 at 60fps, it seemed like something of a myth, the idea of playing a game in such a glorious fashion, his jaw dropped and almost shattered his keyboard, he saw the links appear across the screen, the purchase took place a week later, each part coming in one by one, he pieced the machine together like the assembly of a car, each part falling into place, the case was shut, the power button pushed, the operating system installed and the journey of a better gaming experience had begun.</p>

<p>Praise GabeN, and thanks for the giveaway.</p>

<p><strong>A story from /u/hobbit9797:</strong></p>

<p>On the beach, where one wave was sucking a single shingle, I met a man. He told me about his life. He once had an idea. He wanted to create a system on which mankind could play for eternity and he had a dream…</p>

<p>“I saw a landscape beautiful and untouched. There was a beach with single waves hitting the shingles on the shore and three birds are flying in a white sky. I heard the sound of a trombone and masses of men came down from the sky and rose from the ground. They were clothed in robes green and blue and black. In a time that felt likey minutes they constructed entire cities and factory halls and office buildings.
The beach perished and instead of birds there were black blocks of plastic and metal in a dark grey sky. When the mey finished their construction, they began to fight over which block was the best. Which block had the most ‘features’. Which block looked best.</p>

<p>The men soon disappeared one after another but the black blocks stood firm with flashing red lights coming out from them. Then I heard a second trombone and a deep and strong voice said: ‘Let it be new!’. The blocks crumbled and became shingles again. The sky cleared up and was white first and then blue. Birds came flying from the ocean and filled the sky with their sound. It was good.”</p>

<p>Scared by his dream he decided to live alone on the beach. He dreamt about one day when his idea of a perfect gaming system finally comes alive. But whenever he tried to build with electronics, the static discharge destroyed his works. And he kept being a mad man dreaming about black cases, television and game discs…</p>

<p>Somewhere else another man had the same dream. But unlike the first man he was gifted. He created the one system to rule the all. A system that is as complex as easy to work with. A system that could shatter the black dream blocks by its pure existenc. This system was his personal computer…</p>
