    <p>The edited version of this article is posted on <a href="http://opensource.com/">Opensource.com</a>: <a href="http://opensource.com/life/15/2/beginners-guide-github">A beginner’s guide to GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>In this post I’m going to share with you a few reasons why I consider GitHub as my favorite technology-related company. If you still don’t know what GitHub is, you should continue reading this article because I’m going to share with you some of the most popular features GitHub has integrated in their service.</p>

<p><a href="https://aleksandartodorovic.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/github_logo.png"><img src="https://aleksandartodorovic.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/github_logo.png?w=300" alt="GitHub logo" /></a></p>

<h2 id="what-is-github">What is GitHub?</h2>

<blockquote>GitHub is a web-based Git repository hosting service, which offers all of the distributed revision control and source code management (SCM) functionality of Git as well as adding its own features.</blockquote>

<p>This is the definition I borrowed from a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub">GitHub Wikipedia article</a>. In short terms, it’s a place where every developer (or a student soon-to-be developer like me) can share their source code and their stories with the world. It’s a huge and highly respected collaboration platform.</p>

<p>It’s been used by every big technology company you can think of. Let me give you a few examples: <a href="https://github.com/google">Google</a>, <a href="https://github.com/twitter">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Github">Mozilla</a>, <a href="http://microsoft.github.io/">Microsoft</a>, <a href="https://code.facebook.com/projects/">Facebook</a>, <a href="http://adobe.github.io/">Adobe</a>, <a href="http://ibm.github.io/">IBM</a>, <a href="https://github.com/yahoo">Yahoo!</a>, <a href="https://github.com/linkedin">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="http://netflix.github.io/">Netflix</a>, <a href="https://github.com/dropbox">Dropbox</a> and <a href="https://github.com/paypal">PayPal</a>. Still think GitHub doesn’t have a huge support? What if I told you that <a href="https://github.com/WhiteHouse">White House</a> uses it too? I bet you didn’t know that some of these organizations even participate in the open source community at all!</p>

<p>So, why have they all chosen GitHub as a platform?</p>

<h2 id="a-great-place-to-store-your-code">A Great Place to Store Your Code</h2>

<p>Let’s be honest, today, if you’re not hosting your source code on GitHub, your open source project does not exist. I have a lot of respect for other solutions such as <a href="http://launchpad.net/">Launchpad</a> and <a href="https://bitbucket.org/">BitBucket</a>, but lets be honest, GitHub is the place to go if you need a place to share your source code.</p>

<h2 id="huge-developer-community">Huge Developer Community</h2>

<blockquote>There are 8.2M people collaborating right now across 19M repositories on GitHub. Developers from all around the world are building amazing things together. Their story is our story.</blockquote>

<p>I borrowed this quote from GitHub’s <a href="https://github.com/about">press page</a>. Over <em>eight million people</em> is not a small number, and they’ve all chosen GitHub as their choice. Together, they’ve created around 19 million repositories.</p>

<h2 id="github-as-a-replacement-for-linkedin">GitHub as a Replacement for LinkedIn</h2>

<p>Don’t get me wrong, I love LinkedIn and I’m using it myself for quite some time (you can find my LinkedIn profile <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/aleksandartodorovic">here</a>). But the truth is, you can post pretty much anything you want on LinkedIn and you can perfect your profile in any way you want. GitHub does not allow you to do the same.</p>

<h4 id="everything-you-publish-on-github-you-prove-it-right-away">Everything you publish on GitHub, you prove it right away.</h4>

<p>As an example, lets say that you posted on LinkedIn that you know how to program using C++. Your connections can endorse your skill and your employer can be sure that you know how to program using C++ if enough of your connections endorse it. But, if he visits your GitHub profile, he can see your C++ knowledge in action. He can read the code you’ve posted and based on the code, he can make sure that you’re a creative and a collaborative person, and that you have an experience in working with C++.</p>

<p>Now don’t get me wrong, your GitHub is not a replacement for your resume and you should not think of it as a replacement for your resume. <strong>But</strong>, it is a place where you can show your skills instead of talking about them. And there are some projects like <a href="https://osrc.dfm.io/">Open Source Report Card</a> that grabs your public GitHub data and represents them in a way that’s pretty similar to a resume (check out my Open Source Report Card <a href="https://osrc.dfm.io/aleksandar-todorovic/">here</a>).</p>

<h2 id="github-pages">GitHub Pages</h2>

<p>Now, let’s say that you want to build a website that represents you, your organization, your company, or anything else. You have a couple of options. You can buy your own domain and hosting service and build it from scratch. You can choose some freemium service like <a href="http://www.wix.com/">Wix</a>, where you will create a stunning website in minutes without any coding knowledge, but you will be limited to the features that service allows you to do.</p>

<p>So, lets say that you want to have a full control over your site, <em>without</em> any limitations what so ever, <em>and</em> you showcase your website development and design skills in the process, all of that <em>completely free of charge</em>. The solution? <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>! You can create your personal website, a website for your organization or a website for your project straight away. And it’s not really complicated to do that. Don’t believe me? Check out my <a href="http://aleksandar-todorovic.github.io/">online portfolio</a>! It took me less than 15 minutes to create it using a template offered by GitHub, and I have a full control of that website, which explains how I managed to alter the design of the template called Hack by <a href="https://github.com/bleikamp">Ben Bleikamp</a> (see how original template looks like <a href="http://sundaykofax.github.io/baby-legs/">here</a>).</p>

<h2 id="github-training">GitHub Training</h2>

<p>GitHub uses Git, which is a distributed revision control system designed and developed by Linus Torvalds for Linux kernel development back in 2005. It has become the most widely adopted version cotrol system for software development there is (<a href="https://ianskerrett.wordpress.com/2014/06/23/eclipse-community-survey-2014-results/">source</a>).</p>

<p>Now, lets say that you don’t know how to work with Git, the same way I didn’t know how how to work with Git not too long ago. Problem? Heck no! All resources for working with Git using GitHub as a platform are already provided for you by GitHub itself! GitHub offers you free resources (or training kits as they call them) <a href="https://training.github.com/kit/">here</a> and you also have a few free online courses available <a href="https://training.github.com/classes/">here</a>. Whatever learning option you choose to use out of those provided, you’ll see that your materials are divided in three difficulties: beginner/foundations, intermediate or advanced.</p>

<h2 id="github-gists">GitHub Gists</h2>

<p>This is the newest addition to the GitHub services. It’s a place where you’re able to share your text or a part of your code publicly (which means that your gist will be searchable by a search engine and viewed from your profile) or privately (which means that only people you choose are going to be able to view it, and you share Gists with them by simply copying a link).</p>

<h2 id="atom-text-editor">Atom Text Editor</h2>

<p>After I found out about <a href="https://atom.io/">Atom</a>, I fell in love with GitHub all over again. Atom is a hackable text editor for the 21st Century (as advertised by GitHub).</p>

<p>So, a hackable text editor, what does that even mean?</p>

<p>That means that you can hack every single thing inside of that text editor. Don’t know how? Not to worry, there are thousands of packages <a href="https://atom.io/packages">already available</a>, all of them hosted on GitHub and offered free of charge. Don’t like the design of the editor? Pick your favorite flavor of Atom out of thousands of them available <a href="https://atom.io/themes">here</a>. You can customize your installation to be anything from a simple text editor to a full IDE (short for Integrated Development Environment). Heck, you can even write your publications, your blog posts or your books in it. In fact, I even used it to write the post you’re currently reading (see the picture below) in the same way I’m using it to write every single post on <a href="https://aleksandartodorovic.wordpress.com/">my blog</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://aleksandartodorovic.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/screenshot-from-2015-01-25-024501.png"><img src="https://aleksandartodorovic.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/screenshot-from-2015-01-25-024501.png?w=300" alt="Picture of how I wrote this post" /></a></p>

<h2 id="github-student-developer-pack">GitHub Student Developer Pack</h2>

<p>This is something I recently discovered. A few days ago, I got a letter from my collage professor stating that as a student, I’m eligible to get a <a href="https://education.github.com/pack">GitHub Student Developer Pack</a>, which offers me over 15 free and paid development tools from GitHub and its partners at a huge discount. Now, I should point out that I’m still in the verification process at the time this article is published. This process could last for weeks! But, I should also point out that a guy called Alex Fernandez from GitHub staff has personally apologized to me for that. The reason why this process lasts for so long is because they have to review each request manually, which does take quite some time.</p>

<p><a href="https://aleksandartodorovic.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/github-mark-64px.png"><img src="https://aleksandartodorovic.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/github-mark-64px.png" alt="GitHub-Mark-64px" /></a></p>

<h2 id="github-has-an-amazing-support">GitHub Has an Amazing Support</h2>

<p>I’m a developer. I use a lot of stable and unstable software and services on a daily basis and it is important to me to get the support as fast as possible. I had an issue with a certain GitHub feature so I decided to contact <a href="https://github.com/contact">GitHub support</a>. I’ve got an email response in like 20 minutes, and they’ve been very helpful in the process. They’ve managed to explain to me why I had this issue and what I had to do to resolve it. I have to give them a straight 10/10 for their support.</p>

<h2 id="so-if-you-are-a-developer-is-there-a-reason-not-to-use-github">So, if you are a developer, is there a reason <em>not</em> to use GitHub?</h2>

<p>Honestly, I don’t think there is. If you’re developing a proprietary software, there are plenty of reasons why you should not post the source code of your application on GitHub. But, that should not stop you from working on open source software in your free time. By doing so, it will benefit you (once you start looking for a new job), it will benefit the developers behind a project that you’ve decided to be a part of, and it will benefit every single user of that open source project. GitHub offers you a wide variety of opportunities and you should take advantage of them!</p>

      <h1 class="entry-title"><a href="https://r3bl.github.io/en/manifesto/" rel="bookmark" title="My Manifesto" itemprop="url">My Manifesto</a></h1>
    
  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Across my Reddit feed, I came up with this great article titled <a href="http://www.wiseism.com/write-personal-manifesto/">Why You Should Write a Personal Manifesto</a>, published by <a href="http://wiseism.com/">Wiseism</a>. I feel like this is a great way to keep yourself motivated, so I’ve decided to do just that: to write down my own manifesto.</p>

<p>I’m pretty confident that this manifesto really represents who I truly am, so I’ve decided to share it with you guys.</p>

<p>At the end of the post, there’s a picture with the manifesto that I made because I wanted to use it as my wallpaper. From time to time, I really enjoy reading <a href="http://phrack.org/issues/7/3.html">Hacker’s Manifesto</a>, and I made this Manifesto to replace that occasional reading with something I wrote myself. This Manifesto is not new, it’s saved on my computer for a long time now and I had a different reason to write it. After reading this article, I’ve just rearranged it a little to look more “manifestish” (whatever that means).</p>

<blockquote>
  <h1 id="my-manifesto">My Manifesto</h1>

  <p>I’m not like most of you.</p>

  <p>I do not have emotions. I don’t feel the same way as most people feel. I don’t get hurt easily. I don’t believe I’m going to go to hell if I do something. I don’t believe I should be forbidden to do something I would like to do.</p>

  <p>I’m not a role model of any kind and I’m not trying to be a role model to anyone. I’ve tried most of the things people consider bad. I don’t think that anyone could help me if I don’t want to help myself. I don’t believe anyone will be by my side until death do as apart. I realize I’m on my own in this world and that’s the way I like to live my life.</p>

  <p>When I meet someone, all I see is a game. A game that I can win or loose. I don’t get attached to people, all I see is a way to exploit them. A way to manipulate them to get what I want. And you know what I want? I want to be happy. And I am just that.</p>

  <p>You wanna know why? Because I have something that most of the people surrounding me do not have. I have my mind and I know how to use it. I know how to make the best out of any situation and I’m perfectly happy in every situation I can possibly run into. I’m not saying I’m any more intelligent that you. I’m not saying that I think of myself as some higher species than most of the people. I’m not saying I’ve read more books than you. I’m just saying that I know how to be happy. I know how to feel alive…</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The font used in the picture is my new favorite font called Ubuntu Mono. If you like the design used in this picture, you should thank <a href="tombr.de">Tom Brewe</a> (GitHub username: <a href="https://github.com/nylki">nylki</a>) for creating this awesome syntax theme for <a href="http://atom.io/">Atom</a> called <a href="https://github.com/nylki/pen-paper-coffee-syntax">pen-paper-coffee-syntax</a>. The wallpaper is basically a screenshot of the text (using that syntax theme and Ubuntu Mono font) slightly edited using GIMP.</p>

<p>I’m also thinking about creating a dark version of the wallpaper. If I decide to make it, I will update this post immediately.</p>

<h2 id="uvod">Uvod</h2>

<p>U ovom tekstu neću da pričam o statistici. U koliko vas zanimaju statistike o tome koliko se koja društvena mreža koristi, vrlo lako ćete pronaći sve potrebne podatke na internetu. U ovom tekstu ću da objasnim kako mladi u mojoj lokalnoj zajednici koriste koju društvenu mrežu, gledajući prvenstveno svoje vlastito iskustvo i iskustvo mojih prijatelja (onih van društvenih mreža).</p>

<h2 id="ta-smatram-pod-pojmom-mladi">Šta smatram pod pojmom mladi?</h2>

<p>Pod pojmom mladi u ovom tekstu smatram osobe između 16 i 20 godina. Dakle osobe stare da bi se nazivale tinejdžerima, ali premlade da bi se shvatile ozbiljno u svijetu odraslih osoba.</p>

<h3 id="facebook">Facebook</h3>

<p>Sve više se primjeti da Facebook gubi moć među mojim prijateljima i poznanicima. Većina ga koristi samo zbog <em>chat</em> opcije, koja je mnogo zastupljenija od bilo koje druge IM opcije. Primjeti se da sve manje ljudi objavljuje statuse. Objave se većinom svode na postavljanje novih fotografija, koje u većini slučajeva budu dijeljene sa Instagrama. Takođe se primjeti i da sve manje ljudi iz ove populacije zapravo čita početnu stranicu, te su korisnici sada većinom fokusirani na Facebook grupe, prvenstveno zbog toga što tu nema filtriranja vijesti. Korisnici sve više odustaju od objavljivanja sadržaja baš zbog tih algoritama. Vrlo je teško da će neki vaš <em>post</em> postati popularan ako ništa prije toga niste objavili u posljednjih mjesec dana. Potrebna je predanost i aktivnost da bi bili čitani. Zbog toga je većina mojih prijatelja počela da traži alternativne metode da bi bili čitani.</p>

<p>Koristi ga oko 95% osoba koje poznajem.</p>

<h3 id="twitter">Twitter</h3>

<p>Twitter je vrlo specijalna društvena mreža na našim prostorima. Nema ogroman broj korisnika među nama, međutim oni koji ga koriste, to rade u ogromnim količinama. Provođenje nekoliko sati bez prestanka čitajući “lajnu” i postavljajući tvitove je postala sasvim normalna stvar. Uopšteno, ljudi ga koriste kao neku vrstu dnevnika, sa određenom dozom želje za pažnjom i sticanja “uticajnosti”, slike su rijetkost, a većina ljudi koje poznajem ne koriste svoj pravi identitet prilikom korišćenja ove društvene mreže, te se zbog tih razloga mnogo češće susrećemo sa govorima mržnje nego na ostalim društvenim mrežama. Govori mržnje su prvenstveno fokusirani protiv pojedinaca koji ne koriste ovu društvenu mrežu. Međutim, ukoliko mislite da bi se uklanjanjem anonimnosti riješio govor mržnje, želim da vas podsjetim da <a href="https://aleksandartodorovic.wordpress.com/2014/12/04/anonimnost-nije-rjesenje/">uklanjanje anonimnosti nije rješenje</a> za borbu protiv govora mržnje. Evidentno je i da je novoj osobi koja se pridruži ovoj mreži potrebna ogromna količina truda da bi bila prihvaćena od strane “iskusnijih” tviteraša.</p>

<p>Koristi ga oko 50% osoba koje poznajem.</p>

<h3 id="tumblr">Tumblr</h3>

<p>Nešto između vlastitog bloga i Twitter profila je upravo Tumblr. Mjesto gdje osobe koje poznajem pronalaze inspiraciju, maštaju o nekom idealnom životu, te objavljuju uopšteno slike stvari koje im se sviđaju. Početna na Tumblr-u je obično prepuna slika, a kao ultimativni razlog zašto se toliki broj mojih prijatelja i poznanika okreće upravo ovoj društevnoj mreži ispred vođenja vlastitog bloga smatram lakoću vođenja bloga preko repostovanja stvari koje nam se sviđaju.</p>

<p>Koristi ga oko 20% osoba koje poznajem.</p>

<h3 id="instagram">Instagram</h3>

<p>Ne koristim ovu društvenu mrežu i, da budem iskren, ne razumijem u potpunosti poentu ove društvene mreže, međutim sasvim je očigledno da ovaj servis sve veći broj mojih Facebook prijatelja koristi kao način za dijeljenje fotografija na Facebook-u.</p>

<p>Koristi ga oko 40% osoba koje poznajem.</p>

<h3 id="gag">9gag</h3>

<p>Iako cilj ovog sajta nije da postane društvena mreža, evidentno je da uvođenjem 9gag profila i količinom komentara ispod svakog viralnog posta 9gag ide prema tom pravcu. Posjetioci 9gag-a se u velikoj mjeri drže zajedno i vrlo je lako novoj osobi da postane dio te zajednice.</p>

<p>Koristi ga oko 20% osoba koje poznajem.</p>

<h3 id="reddit">Reddit</h3>

<p>Poznajem još samo dvije osobe koje su aktivne na Reddit-u. Iako vrlo nepopularan među osobama koje poznajem, evidentno je da ga osobe koje ga koriste koriste u vrlo velikoj mjeri. Smatra se vrlo “zrelom” socijalnom mrežom, sa mnogo konstruktivnih i objektivnih rasprava o trenutno aktuelnim temama.</p>

<h3 id="vlastiti-blogovi">Vlastiti blogovi</h3>

<p>Ova metoda društvene pripadnosti je vrlo rijetka među mojim poznanicima. Pored mene, poznajem još samo dvije osobe koje vode svoj blog, međutim, za razliku od mene, te dvije osobe svoj blog vode anonimno, bez želje da ih čitaju ljudi ih poznaju van društvenih mreža.</p>

<h2 id="zakljuak">Zaključak</h2>

<p>Smatram da je za uspijeh neke društvene mreže vrlo važno uzeti u obzir način na koji bi ga potencijali korisnici koristili. Iako je bitno ponuditi nešto novo korisnicima, vrlo je evidentno i da korisnici neće prihvatiti tu društvenu mrežu ukoliko je ne počne koristiti određena doza poznanika.</p>

<p>Takođe, evidentno je i da društvene mreže koje su bazirane na to da budu ultimativno rješenje za vođenje društvenog života počinju da propadaju, što bih naveo kao razlog sve većeg nezadovoljstva korišćenjem Facebook-a i potpunoj propasti Google+-a kao društvene mreže. Moglo bi se reći da moji poznanici pri korišćenju društvenih mreža prate Linux filozofiju, tako što traže jedan servis preko kojeg će da rade tačno određeni zadatak umjesto da koriste ultimativna društvena rješenja.</p>

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>In this post, I’m going to share with you a couple of programs / web services / apps that I’ve started using regularly in 2014. I’ve discovered some of them in 2013, but in 2014 I really started to use them on a regular basis. I hope that you will find something for yourself in my list.</p>

<h3 id="best-operating-system-elementary-os-freyahttpelementaryosorg">Best operating system: <a href="http://elementaryos.org/">elementary OS Freya</a></h3>

<p>I’ve been using elementary OS since 2013. But it definitely became my primary operating system in 2014. I haven’t used Windows in months now and I’m not missing anything. Plus, It’s a real joy participating in the development since the release of Beta 1 version. I’m also <a href="https://aleksandartodorovic.wordpress.com/2014/11/11/elementary-os-bosnian-language/">translating elementary OS to Bosnian language</a> in my free time. Too bad I haven’t finished my job by the end of 2014, but I think that the translation is pretty much usable by now.</p>

<h3 id="best-text-editor-atomhttpsatomio">Best text editor: <a href="https://atom.io/">Atom</a></h3>

<p>This is a hackable text editor for the 21st century, as advertised by worldly-known <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>. I’ve been using it for a couple of months and loving every single aspect of it. In fact, I’m writing this and every single other article in it using Markdown as a styling language before posting them to Wordpress.</p>

<h3 id="best-productivity-apps-todotxthttptodotxtcom-gitithttpgititnet-and-rescuetimehttprescuetimecom">Best productivity apps: <a href="http://todotxt.com/">Todo.txt</a>, <a href="http://gitit.net/">Gitit</a> and <a href="http://rescuetime.com/">RescueTime</a></h3>

<p>I’ve been using <a href="http://evernote.com/">Evernote</a> for a couple of months, but the clunky interface of the desktop version for Windows and the fact that there is no official Linux client really started to annoy me big time.</p>

<p>So I’ve started looking for the alternatives and Todo.txt in a combination with Gitit looks like a perfect alternative to me. So, what I’ve started doing is writing my notes inside a wiki that I’m running on my local machine (using Gitit as a platform).</p>

<p>I’m using Todo.txt as my to-do list natively in Linux using <a href="https://github.com/mNantern/QTodoTxt">QTodoTxt</a> and so far it works great! Been using it for a couple of months now and I see no reason why I won’t be using it throughout 2015.</p>

<p>RescueTime is not really a productivity app. It’s more of a way to see how productive you are really. With the native application running in the background, I can see how much of my time has been spent doing something productive. Native Linux client and Firefox add-on are a perfect combination for me.</p>

<h3 id="best-tools-for-communication-pidginhttppidginim-my-bloghttpsaleksandartodorovicwordpresscom-and-twitterhttpstwittercomr3bl">Best tools for communication: <a href="http://pidgin.im/">Pidgin</a>, <a href="https://aleksandartodorovic.wordpress.com/">my blog</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/r3bl_">Twitter</a></h3>

<p>I’m really loving the way Pidgin is integrated in my operating system. I’ve been using it since 2013, but now I’m using it exclusively to chat with my Facebook friends. In fact, I’m opening Facebook no more than once a day now, which means that most of my time is spent doing something a little bit more productive.</p>

<p>I really found myself in the management of this blog. I’m enjoying every second of writing stuff for my audience and I’m pretty satisfied with the <a href="https://aleksandartodorovic.wordpress.com/2015/01/01/blog-stats-2014/">support I’m getting from you guys</a>.</p>

<p>Twitter has been my primary social network since the end of the 2013. But, in 2014, I’ve started running two Twitter profiles, one personal, and one for my business communications. I’ve managed to bond with some awesome people and learn a lot by reading articles other people are suggesting to me through their Twitter feed.</p>

<h3 id="best-cloud-service-megahttpsmegaconz">Best cloud service: <a href="https://mega.co.nz/">MEGA</a></h3>

<p>Although I have 1 TB of space on <a href="http://onedrive.live.com/">OneDrive</a> and one more TB of space in <a href="https://cloud.mail.ru/">Mail.Ru Cloud</a>, I have to select MEGA as my favourite for 2014. Unlike Mail.Ru Cloud and OneDrive it has a perfectly integrated Linux client and 50 GB of space is enough to satisfy my needs for now, although I’m planning to switch to some premium plan in the near future.</p>

<h3 id="best-reading-services-kindlehttpsreadamazoncom-and-digghttpdiggcom">Best reading services: <a href="https://read.amazon.com/">Kindle</a> and <a href="http://digg.com/">Digg</a></h3>

<p>It’s been a while since I’ve discovered Kindle ebook readers. I’m still thinking about whether should I buy one or not. In the meantime, I’m really enjoying reading books through the online interface of the Kindle reader. I have over 150 books in my library now thanks to the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/freeebooks">Free eBooks subreddit</a> and a simple <a href="https://ifttt.com/myrecipes/personal/17091741">IFTTT recipe</a> which sends me the daily digest of new posts. I haven’t payed a dime for any of the books in it and I have books that are probably worth more than $1,000 dollars by now.</p>

<p>Digg is the perfect way for me to stay in touch with the latest news from my favourite blogs (such as those in my blogroll in the sidebar).</p>

<h3 id="best-multimedia-services-popcorn-timehttppopcorntimeio-spotifyhttpswwwspotifycomus-and-clementinehttpswwwclementine-playerorg">Best multimedia services: <a href="http://popcorntime.io/">Popcorn Time</a>, <a href="https://www.spotify.com/us/">Spotify</a> and <a href="https://www.clementine-player.org/">Clementine</a></h3>

<p>Even though I’m not a huge fan of pirating (I’m all about open source software and creative commons), the fact <em>is</em> that I live in a country where most of the movies and TV shows are not available. Popcorn Time really helps me to be in touch with my favourite TV shows and I’m loving the simplicity and the design of the application itself.</p>

<p>I’m from Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina, a country with <em>no</em> music streaming service <em>at all</em>. That’s why I’ve had to wake the hacker inside of me and found a solution to run Spotify as my choice. Basically, I’m using <a href="http://www.vpnbook.com/freevpn">OpenVPN</a> once every 15 days to log into my Spotify account and then I enter a “vacation mode”, which enables me to run Spotify for the next 15 days. And Spotify does have a <a href="https://www.spotify.com/int/download/other/">Spotify for Linux Preview</a> client which, although a bit unstable, does the job perfectly for me so far.</p>

<p>And now, why am I including Clementine in this list? Well, it’s because of the Internet streaming option. I’m a big <a href="http://www.di.fm/">Digitally Imported</a> fan for quite some time and recently I’ve started listening to <a href="http://somafm.com/">SomaFM</a> in the background while I’m doing something productive. I’ve chosen Clementine because it’s the perfect <em>out-of-the-box</em> solution for streaming those two services. In fact, I’m listening to my favourite Digitally Imported station called <a href="http://www.di.fm/bassnjackinhouse">Bass &amp; Jackin’ House</a> right now.</p>

<h3 id="games-2048httpgabrielecirulligithubio2048-0h-h1http0hh1com-and-south-park-the-stick-of-truthhttpsenwikipediaorgwikisouthparkthestickoftruth">Games: <a href="http://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/">2048</a>, <a href="http://0hh1.com/">0h H1</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Park:_The_Stick_of_Truth">South Park: The Stick of Truth</a></h3>

<p>I don’t have any desire to play any complicated graphical game anymore. I’ve started to be a fan of logical games such as 2048 and Oh H1. The reason why I’m loving these two games is because they’re pretty simple to play, and the fact is that I’m not playing them for hours like I’ve used to play games like <a href="http://worldoftanks.eu/">World of Tanks</a> and <a href="https://www.2k.com/games/nba-2k15">NBA by 2k Sports</a>.</p>

<p>From time to time, everyone needs a good amount of laugh. That’s why I really enjoyed playing South Park video game. Simple graphical interface + a good amount of humour is the winning combination in my case. I really wish that there’s a Linux version of it.</p>

    <p>Wow, this is the first time (although I can’t guarantee you that it will be the last) that I’m going to share with you a story that was <em>not</em> written by myself. And there’s an excellent reason for that. I don’t think that I’ve read a single story (or an article if you please) that had so much influence on me about today’s technology. It was written by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quinn_Norton"><strong>Quinn Norton</strong></a> and published in a book called <a href="http://www.shareconference.net/en/news/share-book"><strong>Share This Book (2012)</strong></a> by <a href="http://www.shareconference.net/en"><strong>Share Foundation</strong></a>. Please, read it thoroughly. I promise you that you <em>will</em> be amazed by this astonishing piece of writing.</p>

<blockquote>

&gt;
&gt; ## **Advice for Living in this World**
&gt;
&gt;
Every day is stranger than the last one.

Each of us has a point where we fall short, where we can’t go on at this mad pace. We ride the wave as long as we can until we start to drown in time and change, and nothing makes sense anymore. And then we fight back from that insanity. This is so common an experience, it’s practically a rite of passage in our new online lives.

Somewhere along the way our networks exceeded us. We spent 12,000 years carving civilization out of the wild, and at the very edge of
its most technical, most complex, most beautiful moment, it became wild again. Like a matryoshka doll of our human disasters, from within our safe, designed and managed world, we built forests of infinite darkness. In the spaces between our devices, we populated this new wild with the predatorial spirits we’d exterminated from the outer landscape. Once again we face disease, dark creatures, black magics, and the all-seeing eyes of evil gods, all in the worlds we’ve created between us, all embedded in our most logical and mathematical system.

Technological life is just becoming life, it takes the weird and violent paths of life. Our network is biologically complex, unpredictable, a state of nature. It’s obtaining the qualities of forests, seas, galaxies -- filled with unearthly beauty, the apprehension of which will pull the breath from your lungs. And like nature, it’s complex and messy and every story, every single one, ends in death.

We need the oldest human tools for this new landscape. This is an age of elemental magic, battling wizards, and capricious gods. To make sense of this world, the routers and servers need their own nymphs and dryads, cable lays need the Shinto river gods, and we need to see Coyote and Raven passing through the application layer, bickering and upsetting the world as they go, but eventually bringing us pieces of the sun.

These are the opening moments of a mythic age, a polytheistic age. The drab but reliable monotheism, the old man God, and the careful
and slow secular rationalism he engendered, then fought, kept order in the world for a long time. God and Secular Rationalism were both
cut from the same cloth, mostly by reasonable men with proper ways to go about things that made the world predictable, rational, reasonable, hierarchal. But they couldn’t run fast enough to catch us in the 21st century. We overwhelmed them with a trillion tiny imps, little daemon servants that spawned, made trouble, and died before an ant could so much as shake its legs. We can still hear the Old Man and Rationalism screaming in the ever receding distance behind us, and before us, a world of chaos and weird constructed and endlessly self constructing from their technological inventions.

Our laptops will live in the corners of our domiciles, and we will take them with us, like the ancestral Roman housegods. We will come to see programming as magical incantations: cantrips that make small things happen, or great and long rituals that can stop time or turn the world from light to dark. We increasingly live in fear of these magics, not understanding them, but knowing there are those few gifted and sinister humans who do.

And the stories we will have, of them, of us! In the coming years we are going to need many gods to make sense of this world. We will
write many new myths to teach our loved ones and keep them safe. With no chance of understanding it all, we will need superstitions to guide us through the forests of the net. We face the old magic of ghosts in our machines, the sympathetic magic of DNA samples, and the voodoo of control in true names. Any sufficiently advanced magic turns out to be indistinguishable from technology.

I encourage you to pick up one of the old religions, and an amulet against the evil eye-- perhaps TOR + one of those lovely mediterranean glass beads. Read the old myths, and consider how they might be useful, how they are, in fact, true now. Find out the basic sigils that folks use in dark woods, and carry talismans against things that prey on network travelers in the downcycle night. We have ways for times like these, we just haven’t used them in a while. These are the things we need to dust off, gods and myths are
how we manage unmanageable nature-- even if we supposedly built it. Without them, we are lost, outdated, clinging to old ways and being harvested by evil things that eat the slow and careful. Nature, even this strange network nature we’ve created, does not reduce, it does not compress, and like all free things, it is terribly dangerous.

Rationalism had its run, but it’s just not rational anymore.</blockquote>
