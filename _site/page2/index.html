    <p>As of June 1st, I became a Community Moderator for the <a href="http://www.redhat.com/">Red Hat</a> supported brand called <a href="http://opensource.com">Opensource.com</a>. As such, I made a one year long commitment to provide content for the site on a regular basis.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-opensourcecom">What is Opensource.com?</h2>

<p><img src="https://scontent-vie1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xfa1/v/t1.0-9/10364012_10152413917218057_7234927818863897908_n.png?oh=ef6d5d3af9d5ce1bba0b7e8ada916b6d&amp;oe=560A6D39" alt="image" /></p>

<p>Opensource.com is a news website that features stories about the ways open source principles—what the site’s community calls “the open source way”—are affecting the world outside the domain of software development.</p>

<p>The site is supported by Red Hat and as such it remains ad-free since its inception back in 2010.</p>

<h2 id="my-first-contact-with-the-opensourcecom-team">My first contact with the Opensource.com team</h2>

<p>I’ve been reading articles published by Opensource.com ever since I started my open source journey. I learned many things about open source from their articles and their <a href="http://opensource.com/resources">resources page</a> helped me to shape my knowledge in open source software in what it is today.</p>

<p>I always wanted to contribute to their site, but my writing skills were nowhere near good enough to be featured on such a high-profile website. It was one of the main reasons why I started my blog in the first place.</p>

<p>While I was writing posts to my blog, my writing skills had improved. A few months later, during my transition to this new domain, I had written an article called <a href="https://r3bl.github.io/en/why-github-is-my-favorite-company/">Reasons Why GitHub is My Favorite Technology-Related Company</a>. I finally felt like I had written something meaningful enough to be featured on a larger website. Of course, Opensource.com was the first website I had in mind.</p>

<p>I contacted the Opensource.com team, presented them my article and I was lucky because, during that time, they had planned to start a series of articles called <a href="https://opensource.com/resources/beginners-open-source">Beginners to Open Source</a>. A slightly edited version of my article fitted right in this series, so on February 16th, my article was published by the title <a href="https://opensource.com/life/15/2/beginners-guide-github">A beginner’s guide to GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>This article got <em>huge</em> support right from the start, with over 16,000 views in the first two days since it was released. It quickly became their <a href="http://opensource.com/life/15/2/top-5-articles-week-february-20">#1 pick of the week</a> and the article was on a good way to become the article of the month. In their <a href="http://opensource.com/community-report-march-2015">report for the month of February 2015</a>, it was revealed that this article managed to get 19,302 views, topping other 73 articles published in that month. It placed 2nd by the number of overall views from that month. It has 54,839 views while I’m writing this post.</p>

<p>I had a number of emails from the team congratulating me on the support the article was getting and I instantly knew that my collaboration with this site was just beginning. Pretty soon, I had satisfied the criteria needed to apply to the Community Moderator role, so I had decided to apply.</p>

<h2 id="the-beginning-of-my-opensourcecom-community-moderator-journey">The beginning of my Opensource.com Community Moderator journey</h2>

<p>After the Skype meeting with one of the community managers of the team, we have decided that I will officially start my volunteering on June 1st. By doing so, I made a one year long commitment to provide them with the regular content and to keep an eye to keep the comments section on their articles, making sure that they are appropriate for the site. In return, I got some awesome badges on <a href="http://opensource.com/users/r3bl">my Opensource.com profile</a>, I will receive some goodies and I got invited to be a part of the <a href="http://allthingsopen.org/">All Things Open</a> conference later this year.</p>

<p>I even got an awesome new email alias: <a href="aleksandar.todorovic@opensource.com">aleksandar.todorovic@opensource.com</a> and I’m now included in the <a href="http://opensource.com/opensourcecom-team">Meet the team</a> section.</p>

<p>But, on top of all, I got a chance to be a part of the awesome community, to be a part of an awesome team and to expand my network to a couple more countries. This is the greatest thing I could get.</p>

<h2 id="first-impressions">First impressions</h2>

<p>With one article already published on this site, two more had already been submitted to our editorial team. I had conducted my first interview with the of the speakers in this year’s <a href="http://www.devnation.org/">DevNation</a>. The whole team seems pretty well organized and dedicated to keeping the site as awesome as it can get. I feel like I managed to fit right in.</p>

<p>I had read an excellent book by Jason Hibbest (one of the members of our team) called <a href="http://theopensourcecity.com/">The foundation for an open source city</a> and I’m currently reading a recently published book by Jim Whitehurts (CEO, Red Hat) called <a href="http://opensource.com/open-organization">The Open Organization: Igniting Passion and Performance</a>.</p>

<p>I feel really proud to be a part of such an awesome team and I’m looking forward to leaving my mark on the Opensource.com.</p>

  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>I know that we live in a shitty part of the world. But getting pulled over by a police officer and suggesting that he requested a bribe from you simply because you misunderstood him is a new level of being a huge douchebag.</p>

<h2 id="the-story">The Story</h2>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IPhYl81--fY" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p><a href="http://watchdog.org/">Watchdog</a> reporter called <a href="http://watchdog.org/author/yael/">Yaël Ossowski</a> came to our region to cover the story of <a href="https://liberland.org/en/main/">Libreland</a>, a small (7 square kilometers) self-proclaimed country sitting between Serbia and Croatia. I don’t know if he published the story or not, but there was an event after it that got huge attention not just in Serbia, but in our entire region.</p>

<p>He was pulled over for speeding by a Serbian police officer near the border of Serbia and Hungary. The officer who stopped him did not speak English and he did his very best to explain to the journalist the law that applies for the speeding violation in Serbia. He remained calm during the process and once he realized that they can’t communicate and solve the issue on their own, the police officer decided to call one of his colleagues that spoke English.</p>

<p>To explain the procedure shortly, the price for speeding is 5,000 RSD (approximately 41 EUR). If the violator pays his fine to the police officer right on the spot, he does not pay the full amount of the fine. He only pays 50% of the fine, which is 2,500  RSD (approximately 20 EUR). In both cases, he needs to pay additional 45 RSD (approximately 0,4 EUR) to a post office, which is a tax that post offices take for transferring the money to the state. If a foreign citizen does not have the appropriate amount of money to pay his fine right on the spot, the police officer by Serbian law has the right to confiscate his passport for up to five days until the voilator pays his fine. The violator cannot pay his fine in a foreign currency. Serbia has their own currency (RSD) and unlike most of the Europe, they currently do not accept EUR as their official currency.</p>

<p>As the police officer tried to explain the procedure to the reporter, reporter claimed that the police officer requested him to pay 3,500 RSD. There’s absolutely no proof for this accusation anywhere on the video. You don’t need to take it from me, ask anyone who can speak both Serbian and English regardless of their nationality and they will tell you the same.</p>

<p>The video went viral all over Serbia, Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina and Croatia. Now as you may know, those three countries were at war 20 years ago after the collapse of Yugoslavia. The nations from these countries still haven’t forgot about the war and there’s still a huge tension between those nations (especially in Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina). And then, the reporter tweeted this:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">It seems the nationalists have been set loose. Please read the description of the video. Cop was very happy to accept 50 euros in cash</p>&mdash; Yaël (@YaelOss) <a href="https://twitter.com/YaelOss/status/606367814484664320">June 4, 2015</a></blockquote>
<script async="" src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Now let me tell you something. Uniting the citizens of these three countries over <em>anything</em> is a <em>huge</em> accomplishment for anyone. We do not consider ourselves as the same nation. As an example, if you say to a Serbian that he has the same nationality as a Croatian, in most of the cases, that would be considered as a <em>huge</em> disrespect and some people might even take it as an insult. The same thing applies vise versa. But the fact is that our languages are pretty much the same (I would say around 98%). We can understand each other perfectly, but we will never say that we speak the same language. This is why you have people from all three countries defending the police officer in the comments on the video. As a conclusion, calling us nationalists is just completely incorrect.</p>

<p>Now this video managed to go viral because the reporter showed a huge disrespect towards the police officer. In our countries, insulting the police officer (especially as a foreign citizen) is considered as an insult to the country that he represents. The violator and his colleagues even made a couple of jokes towards Serbia as a country throughout the video, disrespecting the whole country in the process.</p>

<p>The reporter was requested to sign a document admitting that he made a violation. The document was written in Serbian language and the reporter was not able to understand the document he was requested to sign. He has every right to complain about this issue and I’m pretty sure that the police officers would give him the same document translated to English if he followed them to a police station. Unfortunately, the police officers did not have the English version of the document at the spot. Eventually, the reporter went to the nearest exchange office, exchanged his money to an appropriate currency and signed the document he did not understand. After doing so, police officers returned him his passport and he was free to go.</p>

<p>As a reporter, Yaël behaved inappropriately. He tried to accuse Serbian police officer for something he did not do without any evidence supporting his claims. I’m not a reporter, but I am pretty sure that this is completely against his ethics. He still remains ignorant and he does not accept the fact that he is wrong, even though lots and lots of people tried to explain to him the process by commenting on his video, on the post he published on his blog and on Twitter. And on top of that, he is mocking the country of Serbia in the process, with tweets like this one:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I &lt;3 Serbia <a href="http://t.co/A4hveVLrAB">pic.twitter.com/A4hveVLrAB</a></p>&mdash; Yaël (@YaelOss) <a href="https://twitter.com/YaelOss/status/606393796708978688">June 4, 2015</a></blockquote>
<script async="" src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Now please, if you are visiting a foreign country and you get pulled over by a cop, show some respect. Don’t make false accusations. If you’re a reporter, don’t try to make the story where there is no story. And above all, do not insult the citizens of a foreign country and their whole country in the process. Yaël did not behave very civilized. Let this be an example to you how not to behave.</p>

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>GitHub is growing out of the place where you just share your code to something bigger for a while now. Of course, GitHub is still an awesome place to share your code, but there’s more to it. Way more.</p>

<h2 id="you-dont-have-to-be-a-programmer-to-be-a-part-of-the-open-source-project">You don’t have to be a programmer to be a part of the open source project</h2>

<p>I said it (and wrote it) a thousand times, and yet, I feel the urge to say it again. There’s <a href="http://opensource.com/business/14/12/8-ways-contribute-open-source-without-writing-code">more to it</a> than actually writing code. Open source is a self-suficient economy. It’s a way for the people to collaborate, no matter what their expertise is, on a scale that was not possible ever before. And if you’re actually a part of the open source project, there’s no better place to share it <a href="http://opensource.com/life/15/2/beginners-guide-github">than on GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>Now some people might argue that the people used open source software as a way of collaboration for over 20 years, and that’s true. However, I firmly believe that this collaboration has never happened on such a massive scale as it is happening right now. I firmly believe that GitHub, although not the first service who enabled this kind of service, really managed to make a change. GitHub managed to make a service that is easy to use, easy to access and easy to learn. Suddenly, Git doesn’t really seem like a hard thing to learn. And because of that, open source kind of collaboration is now expanding to more than software.  </p>

<h2 id="github-as-a-place-to-collaborate-on-various-projects">GitHub as a place to collaborate on various projects</h2>

<p>There’s lots of things that people want to collaborate on, not just the software. People can do that even easier than ever. Some people want to share <a href="https://github.com/d2kagw/cooking">their cooking recipes</a>, some people want to <a href="https://github.com/crypto101/book">write a book together</a>, and some people want to share their recommendations on various subjects.</p>

<h3 id="presenting-you-githubs-awesome-lists">Presenting you: GitHub’s awesome lists!</h3>

<p>There’s a special repository hosted on GitHub that I really became a fan of recently, and it’s called <a href="https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome">awesome</a>. Basically, it’s a list of awesome lists hosted on GitHub. People want to share their recommendations on various subjects, and now they can. Sure, on that list, you’ll see plenty of lists that will help you to learn more about Computers and IT, but if you look closely, I’m pretty sure you’ll find something for yourself. Like, a list of <a href="https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome-scifi">SciFi novels and movies</a>, or a list of <a href="https://github.com/RichardLitt/awesome-fantasy">Fantasy movies and novels</a>, a list of <a href="https://github.com/najela/discount-for-student-dev">discounts for students</a>, a list of <a href="https://github.com/lukasz-madon/awesome-remote-job">remote working resources</a>,
a list of <a href="https://github.com/RichardLitt/awesome-conferences">conferences</a>, <a href="https://github.com/kyleterry/awesome-radio">radio resources</a>, <a href="https://github.com/jugoncalves/awesome-answers">places to look for answers</a>, <a href="https://github.com/cv/awesome-geek-podcasts">geek podcasts</a>, <a href="https://github.com/heyalexej/awesome-images">free images</a>, and even a list of awesome <a href="https://github.com/matiassingers/awesome-readme">README files</a>.</p>

<p>And that’s the point of that awesome repository. To combine the list of awesome lists. Every single person can contribute to them, making them bigger and better.</p>

<p>So go ahead and pick one. Share your recommendation with others. Encourage others to do so too. Learn together and share together what you’ve learned.</p>

<h3 id="my-awesome-lists">My awesome lists</h3>

<p>Now I’m going to share with you what I’ve done so far. I’m hosting an <a href="https://github.com/aleksandar-todorovic/awesome-c">awesome-c list</a>, a place to share the awesome resources for C programming language all across the Internet. Thanks to my work, I became a collaborator on the <a href="https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome-scifi">awesome-scifi</a> list where you can share your recommendations on anything related to Science Fiction. And finally, I have created a list that will contain links to great blogs all across the Internet called <a href="https://github.com/aleksandar-todorovic/awesome-blogs">awesome-blogs</a>. Feel free to check them out, see our recommendations and share yours. Sure, open source software <em>is</em> great, but lets collaborate on more than just software! Let’s collaborate on everything you can possibly imagine!</p>
