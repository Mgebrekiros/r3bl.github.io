    <p>Wow, this is the first time (although I can’t guarantee you that it will be the last) that I’m going to share with you a story that was <em>not</em> written by myself. And there’s an excellent reason for that. I don’t think that I’ve read a single story (or an article if you please) that had so much influence on me about today’s technology. It was written by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quinn_Norton"><strong>Quinn Norton</strong></a> and published in a book called <a href="http://www.shareconference.net/en/news/share-book"><strong>Share This Book (2012)</strong></a> by <a href="http://www.shareconference.net/en"><strong>Share Foundation</strong></a>. Please, read it thoroughly. I promise you that you <em>will</em> be amazed by this astonishing piece of writing.</p>

<blockquote>

&gt;
&gt; ## **Advice for Living in this World**
&gt;
&gt;
Every day is stranger than the last one.

Each of us has a point where we fall short, where we can’t go on at this mad pace. We ride the wave as long as we can until we start to drown in time and change, and nothing makes sense anymore. And then we fight back from that insanity. This is so common an experience, it’s practically a rite of passage in our new online lives.

Somewhere along the way our networks exceeded us. We spent 12,000 years carving civilization out of the wild, and at the very edge of
its most technical, most complex, most beautiful moment, it became wild again. Like a matryoshka doll of our human disasters, from within our safe, designed and managed world, we built forests of infinite darkness. In the spaces between our devices, we populated this new wild with the predatorial spirits we’d exterminated from the outer landscape. Once again we face disease, dark creatures, black magics, and the all-seeing eyes of evil gods, all in the worlds we’ve created between us, all embedded in our most logical and mathematical system.

Technological life is just becoming life, it takes the weird and violent paths of life. Our network is biologically complex, unpredictable, a state of nature. It’s obtaining the qualities of forests, seas, galaxies -- filled with unearthly beauty, the apprehension of which will pull the breath from your lungs. And like nature, it’s complex and messy and every story, every single one, ends in death.

We need the oldest human tools for this new landscape. This is an age of elemental magic, battling wizards, and capricious gods. To make sense of this world, the routers and servers need their own nymphs and dryads, cable lays need the Shinto river gods, and we need to see Coyote and Raven passing through the application layer, bickering and upsetting the world as they go, but eventually bringing us pieces of the sun.

These are the opening moments of a mythic age, a polytheistic age. The drab but reliable monotheism, the old man God, and the careful
and slow secular rationalism he engendered, then fought, kept order in the world for a long time. God and Secular Rationalism were both
cut from the same cloth, mostly by reasonable men with proper ways to go about things that made the world predictable, rational, reasonable, hierarchal. But they couldn’t run fast enough to catch us in the 21st century. We overwhelmed them with a trillion tiny imps, little daemon servants that spawned, made trouble, and died before an ant could so much as shake its legs. We can still hear the Old Man and Rationalism screaming in the ever receding distance behind us, and before us, a world of chaos and weird constructed and endlessly self constructing from their technological inventions.

Our laptops will live in the corners of our domiciles, and we will take them with us, like the ancestral Roman housegods. We will come to see programming as magical incantations: cantrips that make small things happen, or great and long rituals that can stop time or turn the world from light to dark. We increasingly live in fear of these magics, not understanding them, but knowing there are those few gifted and sinister humans who do.

And the stories we will have, of them, of us! In the coming years we are going to need many gods to make sense of this world. We will
write many new myths to teach our loved ones and keep them safe. With no chance of understanding it all, we will need superstitions to guide us through the forests of the net. We face the old magic of ghosts in our machines, the sympathetic magic of DNA samples, and the voodoo of control in true names. Any sufficiently advanced magic turns out to be indistinguishable from technology.

I encourage you to pick up one of the old religions, and an amulet against the evil eye-- perhaps TOR + one of those lovely mediterranean glass beads. Read the old myths, and consider how they might be useful, how they are, in fact, true now. Find out the basic sigils that folks use in dark woods, and carry talismans against things that prey on network travelers in the downcycle night. We have ways for times like these, we just haven’t used them in a while. These are the things we need to dust off, gods and myths are
how we manage unmanageable nature-- even if we supposedly built it. Without them, we are lost, outdated, clinging to old ways and being harvested by evil things that eat the slow and careful. Nature, even this strange network nature we’ve created, does not reduce, it does not compress, and like all free things, it is terribly dangerous.

Rationalism had its run, but it’s just not rational anymore.</blockquote>

<p>Those stats are nothing special but I’m really proud of them. Now I’m starting to get over 50 visitors on a daily basis (in the last 15 days). After I got a pretty decent amount of initial attention, I’ve decided that this blog is a perfect way for me to express myself. That’s why I’m going to take <a href="https://dailypost.wordpress.com/2014/12/29/blogging-101-january-registration/">Blogging 101</a>, a free online course (starting January the 5th) offered by Wordpress to further my knowledge of running a blog. After all, I love learning new things, which is the main reason why I started this blog in the first place.</p>

<p>I’ve got a huge (and I really mean <strong>huge</strong>) number of drafts prepared for 2015 so expect a new post at least two times a week.</p>

<p>Goals for 2015:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Over 30,000 views (7 times more than in 2014)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Over 20,000 visitors (8 times more than in 2014)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Over 1,000 Twitter followers (10 times more than in 2014)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Loving the support I’m getting from you guys and those numbers definitely suggest to me that I should keep posting. Thanks to every single one of you guys and a happy 2015!</p>

    <p>So, everybody is sharing a list of something they came up with in the year behind them. I’m going to step it up a little. I present to you a very special list of mine. I represent to you the list of quotes that kept me motivated and inspired in 2014. This list is _very _special to me and I’ve decided to give it to you guys as a reward for reading my blog.</p>

<p>So, here we go:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Latin: </strong> Imperare sibi maximum imperium est. - To rule yourself is the ultimate power.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Duane Michals:</strong>  Trust that little voice in your head that says “Wouldn’t it be interesting if…” And then do it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Friedrich Nietzsche:</strong> In individuals, insanity is rare; but in groups, parties, nations, and epochs it is the rule.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Joseph Brodsky:</strong> There are worse crimes than burning books. One of them is not reading them.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Oscar Wilde:</strong> Give a man mask and he’ll tell you the truth.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Jim Morrison: </strong> There can’t be any large-scale revolution until there’s a personal revolution, on an individual level. It’s got to happen inside first.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Napoleon Hill: </strong> Patience, persistence and perspiration make an unbeatable combination for success.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Mark Twain: </strong> Never let your school interfere with your education.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Mark Victor Hansen:</strong>  Don’t wait until everything is just right. It will never be perfect. There will always be challenges, obstacles and less than perfect conditions. So what. Get started now. With each step you take, you will grow stronger and stronger, more and more skilled, more and more self-confident and more and more successful.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Michael Jordan:</strong>  I can accept failure, everyone fails at something. But I can’t accept not trying.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Mae West:</strong>  You only live once, but if you do it right, once is enough.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Frank Zappa:</strong>  If you end up with a boring miserable life because you listened to your mom, your dad, your teacher, your priest, or some guy on television telling you how to do your shit, then you deserve it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Will Smith:</strong> You don’t try to build a wall. You don’t set out to build a wall. You don’t say, “I’m gonna build the biggest baddest greatest wall, that’s ever been build,”, you don’t start there. You say, “I’m gonna lay this brick, as perfectly as a brick can be laid,” and you do that, every single day. And soon you have a wall.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Now, I’m going to represent to you a list of quotes taken from the book called <a href="http://stlcurator.com/henry-goldkamp-what-the-hell-stl/">What The Hell is Saint Louis Thinking? (2014)</a>. It’s a book written by the city itself. It’s written by hundreds of citizens of Saint Louis and there are some quite interesting quotes there.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>We all drive on, walk past each other, not really knowing who we are. We’re all just strangers passing in the street, never stopping or taking the time.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no reason to simply exist. You need to exist for a reason. That reason can be silly to everyone but you. Hold it dear to your heart. Never forget it and never deny it for it is the reason to keep sucking oxygen.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What you do in your life changes what someone else does in theirs, and that changes everything.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are all raindrops. We might seem small and insignificant but together we have the power of the world.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fear keeps me from dreaming so I will not live my life in fear!</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Now, I’m going to share with you a song that kept me motivated in the 2014.</p>

<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkCkCPfDmqQ</p>

<p>Happy 2015. guys! Feel free to share some quote in the comments that influenced you the most in the year behind us!</p>

    <blockquote>We are all raindrops. We might seem small and insignificant, but together we have the power of the world.</blockquote>

<p>This is a quote by an unknown author from a book called <em><a href="http://stlcurator.com/henry-goldkamp-what-the-hell-stl/">What The Hell is Saint Louis Thinking? (2014)</a></em>. It’s an excellent book and I suggest you to read it. Oh, and did I mention that it’s free?</p>

<p>I really think that this quote really covers it all. We all shape the world somehow. Maybe we did something important today, and maybe we didn’t. But even if we didn’t, we might have influenced the world in some indirect way, by bothering someone with our problems and taking their time that might have been spent doing something that might influence the world in a much larger way, or by giving some kind of a motivation to someone which will help him to do something significant.</p>

<p>I keep hearing that “<em>I want to change the world</em>” cliché and frankly, I’m sick of it. It’s not about changing the world, changing the world is something that you do <em>while you’re thinking about changing the world</em>. It’s about changing the world <em>as much as you can</em>. It’s about broadening your change to a much higher spectrum than the average person.</p>

<p>Every action that we take our ancestors took helped to the design the world we live in today. And we need to be quite careful because actions we do <em>now</em> will design the future for our future generations. And every action counts, be it a coffee with someone, writing this, programming something, going to a conference, spending the night drinking, or anything in between.</p>

<p>I’m going to end this with one more quote. I can’t remember where I read it and searching for it on the Internet did not gave me any usable result.</p>

<blockquote>A man has two deaths. The first time when he physically dies, and the second time when his name is mentioned for the last time.</blockquote>

    <p><a href="https://aleksandartodorovic.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/openbaylogo.jpg"><img src="https://aleksandartodorovic.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/openbaylogo.jpg" alt="Open Bay logo" /></a>OK, so, as you probably already know, the official Pirate Bay was shut down 10 days ago. There are plenty of articles already covering this subject. I already stated <a href="https://aleksandartodorovic.wordpress.com/2014/12/14/is-it-time-for-the-pirate-bay-to-disappear-for-good/">my opinion on Pirate Bay disappearing for good</a>, where <a href="http://blog.brokep.com/2014/12/09/the-pirate-bay-down-forever/">I agreed with Peter Sunde</a> (co-founder and ex-spokesperson of the Pirate Bay).</p>

<p>There are already some non-legit Pirate Bay clones <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/fake-pirate-bay-lies-to-press-and-fakes-user-uploads-141215/">like this one</a>, the Pirate Bay <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/the-pirate-bay-has-not-been-resurrected-yet-141210/">has not been ressurrected - yet</a>, the Pirate Bay crew itself <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/pirate-bay-crew-responds-to-the-raid-copies-and-the-future-141215/">does not know</a> will the Pirate Bay come online or not, and researchers <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/bittorrent-anonymous-and-impossible-to-shut-down-141218/">are currently working on</a> making BitTorrent anonymous and impossible to shut down. It’s pretty obvious that the copyright industry <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/how-to-learn-absolutely-nothing-in-fifteen-years-by-the-copyright-industry-141214/">has learned absolutely nothing</a> in the least fifteen years.</p>

<p>The system now is messed up, but that <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/pirate-bay-shutdown-doesnt-stop-people-sharing-141216/">hasn’t stopped people from sharing</a> using their favorite technology.</p>

<h2 id="presenting-open-bay">Presenting: Open Bay</h2>

<p>Out of all those alternatives that came online after the raid, one really stands out and it’s called <a href="https://oldpiratebay.org/">Old Pirate Bay</a>. So, why <em>exactly</em> did it stand out? Well, the whole point is that this copy is from a reputable source (<a href="http://isohunt.to/">isoHunt</a>). Now, isoHunt is taking one step further by doing something Pirate Bay should have done a long time ago: they released the source code of Old Pirate Bay to the public and called it <a href="http://openbay.isohunt.to/">The Open Bay</a>.</p>

<p>You can find all of the source code in the <a href="https://github.com/isohuntto/openbay/">GitHub repository</a>. You can host your own version of the Pirate Bay on your private server. You can even create your local torrent search engine, something I will try to do (if I manage to do that, there will be a tutorial on my blog on how to do that).</p>

<p>The point of doing this is simple: making pirates impossible to stop.</p>

<h2 id="issues">Issues</h2>

<p>Of course, this brigs up so many issues.</p>

<ul>
  <li>How will we know what site is legit?</li>
  <li>How will we update our torrent database?</li>
  <li>How will we know what site does have an updated version of the torrent database?</li>
</ul>

<p>These issues are yet to be resolved. If you do have some suggestions, leave them in the comments bellow or <a href="https://github.com/isohuntto/openbay/issues/new">create an issue</a> on the repository itself. Lets make pirating impossible to stop together!</p>
