				<title>Simple way to integrate social media links into Jekyll website</title>
				
				
					<description>&lt;p&gt;I saw this error happening over and over in a lot of places. People do not integrate their social links using Jekyll. Instead, they hard code them into HTML code. Well, there&amp;#8217;s a better way and it&amp;#8217;s pretty simple.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>My elementary OS Workflow</title>
				
				
					<description>&lt;p&gt;In this post, I&amp;#8217;m going to share with you my workflow and my experience with apps developed specifically for elementary OS. Unfortunately, I&amp;#8217;m not very impressed with the state of apps designed specifically for elementary OS right now, but I do think that the situation will improve by the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>How NOT to Behave When You Get Pulled Over by a Police Officer in a Foreign Country</title>
				
				
					<description>&lt;p&gt;I know that we live in a shitty part of the world. But getting pulled over by a police officer and suggesting that he requested a bribe from you simply because you misunderstood him is a new level of being a huge douchebag.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>How awesome GitHub lists are making GitHub even more awesome!</title>
				
				
					<description>&lt;p&gt;GitHub is growing out of the place where you just share your code to something bigger for a while now. Of course, GitHub is still an awesome place to share your code, but there&amp;#8217;s more to it. Way more.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>On Open Source Advocacy</title>
				
				
					<description>&lt;p&gt;What does it mean to be an open source advocate? Can I really make a difference? How do I do that? There are so many questions about the Open Source Advocacy and, surprisingly, so little answers available.&lt;/p&gt;
