&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://openway.si/&quot;&gt;OpenWay.si&lt;/a&gt; is a conference organized in Novo mesto (Slovenia), promoting open source mentality in different areas. This is their 5th year they’re organizing a conference and it will probably be their biggest conference so far. They’re currently looking for sponsors and speakers, and if you’re interested in helping them, you can apply too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;call-for-speakers&quot;&gt;Call for Speakers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you think that you have an interesting topic related to open source mentality that you would like to share with a wider audience of people, I suggest you to apply your presentation (or a workshop) to &lt;a href=&quot;info@openway.si&quot;&gt;info@openway.si&lt;/a&gt;. Your application must include your full name, an email address where you can be reached at in any time, your short biography, the title of your presentation and a short description of your presentation (and by short I mean below 300 words). While creating your presentation, please keep in mind that presentations will be 30 minutes long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Application deadline: 24th of March, 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;call-for-sponsors&quot;&gt;Call for Sponsors&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you would like to sponsor Open Way, please contact them on the same email address (&lt;a href=&quot;info@openway.si&quot;&gt;info@openway.si&lt;/a&gt;). You can donate your time, your money or other materials that could help them in the organization of their conference. By doing so, your company will gain visibility and you will prove that you are supporting open source mentality (which could increase your sales quite a bit).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Application deadline: 24th of March, 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;more-information&quot;&gt;More Information&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more information, visit &lt;a href=&quot;http://openway.si/&quot;&gt;their website&lt;/a&gt; or check out how their last conference went &lt;a href=&quot;http://2014.openway.si/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I won’t be able to attend this conference since I will be volunteering in The Netherlands at that time as a part of the European Volunteering Service (more on that in a few days). But, I highly recommend you to support this conference, and, if you think you can manage that, help them out a bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Svaki treći web sajt na svijetu je blog. Tri od četiri internet korisnika redovno čitaju blogove. Svakog dana objavi se blizu 3.000.000 blog postova. Pet od šest internet “influensera” su blogeri, a na njih najveći uticaj vrše opet drugi blogeri.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Od 2012. do danas podaci o broju blogera variraju. Uzveši u obzir sve dostupne podatke - na svijetu postoji između 350 miliona i pola milijarde blogova.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do momenta kad završite čitanje ovog teksta biće objavljeno preko 20.000 novih blog postova!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blogosfera bivše Jugoslavije se do 2008. godine eksponencijalno razvijala. U to vrijeme je brojala do čak 1.000.000 blogova. Ali o blogovima u regionu danas znamo manje nego ikada. Blogeri, ne znamo kako ste, a to je važno!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ne znamo šta blogere muči&lt;/strong&gt;, zbog čega ne pišu češće, &lt;strong&gt;da li se osjećaju sigurno&lt;/strong&gt; da objave šta god žele, da li dobijaju podršku prijatelja i od koga trpe pritiske (ukoliko ih trpe); ne znamo koliko ima blogova, na kojim su platformama, &lt;strong&gt;da li su blogeri i blogerke upoznati sa svojim pravima&lt;/strong&gt;, koliko često su ta njihova prava ugrožena… o Blogerima i blogerkama pouzdano znamo manje nego o bilo kom drugom društvenom mediju. A dok nešto ne izmjerimo, ne možemo ga ni razvijati. Dok ne saznamo kako smo, teško je blogosferu unaprijediti do nivoa najznačajnijeg medija društvenog interneta što bi naša blogosfera sigurno mogla da bude!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;elementary OS 0.3 &lt;a href=&quot;beta.elementary.io/&quot;&gt;Freya Beta 2&lt;/a&gt; is out. However, there are things you should not do in the current version of elementary OS. You do not want to make the developers angry, do you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;dont-type-elementary-os-with-the-capital-e-or-refer-to-it-as-eos&quot;&gt;1. Don’t type elementary OS with the capital ‘e’ or refer to it as eOS&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;elementary OS really cares about their brand. This is why you should always spell the name elementary with the lowercase letter ‘e’ (elementary instead of Elementary).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, don’t refer to elementary OS as eOS because developers think that this term is very close to infringing on “iOS”. It reminds people on “eMachines” and they don’t want to see people making “eApps”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;dont-store-important-data-in-the-beta-version-of-elementary-os&quot;&gt;2. Don’t store important data in the beta version of elementary OS&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be sure not to rely on elementary OS Freya Beta 2 while you’re doing something important. Keep in mind that this software is currently in the Beta version, so if you don’t know your way around the system, don’t use it. Use the stable version (&lt;a href=&quot;http://elementary.io/&quot;&gt;0.2 Luna&lt;/a&gt;) instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;dont-report-bugs-in-our-google-community&quot;&gt;3. Don’t report bugs in our Google+ community&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;elementary OS has a pretty big and pretty active &lt;a href=&quot;https://plus.google.com/communities/104613975513761463450&quot;&gt;Google+ community&lt;/a&gt; (and you thought nobody is using Google+). You should not post any bugs you encounter on in this Google+ community. Post them &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugs.launchpad.net/elementary&quot;&gt;on Launchpad&lt;/a&gt; instead. If you have any issues with the new version of the website behind the elementary OS (&lt;a href=&quot;http://beta.elementary.io/&quot;&gt;beta.elementary.io&lt;/a&gt;), post them &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/elementary/mvp/issues&quot;&gt;on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;dont-try-to-upgrade-your-kernel&quot;&gt;4. Don’t try to upgrade your kernel&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a pretty good reason why the current version supports the kernel it supports. If you upgrade your kernel to the more recent version, you will probably experience some bugs that would not happen otherwise. Reporting those issues is pointless and makes the development even more difficult than it currently is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;dont-ask-questions-like-why-is-midori-the-default-web-browser-and-why-is-there-no-office-suite-out-of-the-box&quot;&gt;5. Don’t ask questions like ‘why is Midori the default web browser’ and ‘why is there no office suite out of the box’&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;elementary OS developers want to keep the design of their operating system consistent. Even though Midori is not great, there is just no better web browser that supports headerbars out of the box. This is why there is no way for Firefox (or Chrome) to be included in the elementary OS instead of Midori.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same thing applies to LibreOffice. It does not support headerbars, it does not look good out of the box with elementary OS, therefore, it is not available with the installation of elementary OS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is also true for applications like VLC player, Clementine, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;so-why-doesnt-elementary-os-just-fork-these-projects-and-change-their-design-to-fit-elementary-os&quot;&gt;So, why doesn’t elementary OS just fork these projects and change their design to fit elementary OS?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main reason behind this decision is because elementary OS currently has a pretty small developer community. More developers = more features. If you want to help out elementary OS when you don’t have any coding skills, keep in mind that more donations = more developers = more features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;follow-the-rules-if-you-want-to-use-the-freya-beta-version&quot;&gt;Follow the rules if you want to use the Freya beta version&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;elementary OS Freya Beta 2 is excellent and it is going to be a pretty amazing project &lt;em&gt;once it becomes stable&lt;/em&gt;. If you want your system to be stable, you should use the &lt;a href=&quot;http://elementary.io/&quot;&gt;0.2 Luna version&lt;/a&gt; or look for an alternative operating system until Freya becomes stable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you use the beta version, follow these rules or you’re on your own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;bonus&quot;&gt;Bonus&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t post “Things you should do after installing elementary OS Freya” posts on your blog yet. Freya is currently &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; stable and it probably won’t be for at least two more months. Keep that in mind before posting an article of this kind.&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A few days ago, while I was watching &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/87th_Academy_Awards&quot;&gt;87th Academy Awards&lt;/a&gt;, I made a list of the movies I really wanted to see. On top of that list was a movie called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2084970/&quot;&gt;The Imitation Game (2014)&lt;/a&gt;. This movie follows the life of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing&quot;&gt;Alan Turing&lt;/a&gt;, the man I deeply admire for a couple of months now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/ba/Sackville_Park_Turing_plaque.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just 24 hours ago, I had no idea how much of an influence Alan Turing had, not just to the field of artificial intelligence, but to the history of the world as well, especially in the technology we use today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alan Turing truly was a genius. Probably one of the biggest geniuses in his generation, that is. He had some key contributions in breaking the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enigma_machine&quot;&gt;Enigma machine&lt;/a&gt; during the World War II, which had a huge impact on the result of World War II. He &lt;a href=&quot;http://m.bbc.com/news/technology-18475646&quot;&gt;pioneered&lt;/a&gt; the work in artificial intelligence (even before the term artificial intelligence was established), where he was the first one to discuss the ways of replicating human brain inside of a machine. His papers remain relevant today, 60 years after they were published. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test&quot;&gt;Turing test&lt;/a&gt; (a test which is used to determine is a machine intelligence really indistinguishable from human intelligence) is, of course, named after him as his creator and there’s an annual contest going on each year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, how did the U.K. thank him for his work? By convicting him because of his sexual orientation. He had a choice to accept a hormone treatment or to spend two years in prison. He chose the first option and continued his work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He was found dead two years later. Even though it was believed for more than 50 years that he had committed suicide by eating a poisonous apple (allegedly inspired by his favorite fairy tale Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs), there are some indications that his death might be an accident as &lt;a href=&quot;http://m.bbc.com/news/science-environment-18561092&quot;&gt;explained&lt;/a&gt; by Roland Pease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though the movie has received some excellent reviews and won an Oscar for the Best Adapted Screenplay, not everyone agrees that this movie is historically accurate (as described &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Imitation_Game#Controversy&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nybooks.com/blogs/nyrblog/2014/dec/19/poor-imitation-alan-turing/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, this historical inaccuracy managed to convince me to look for more sources and to find more information about his life. Even though there are quite a lot of different views on his life, all of them agree that he had an interesting, out of the ordinary life, and that he managed to do some of the most amazing technological work at the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really consider him as &lt;a href=&quot;http://m.bbc.com/news/technology-18327261&quot;&gt;the father of computing&lt;/a&gt; and I can’t stop wondering: if he was still alive, would he be completely proud of what we’ve accomplished so far or would he think that we could do much more?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, back to the subject. Because of the movie inaccuracy and the fact that there are so many different ways to learn about Alan Turing, I have decided to create a separate repository with a single Markdown document where I will try to put all of the informations about Alan Turing (and his work) that I can find. I really think that he is an important person in history and that more people need to be educated on what he has really accomplished. This is just a small way of helping people to learn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div data-theme=&quot;medium&quot; data-height=&quot;299&quot; data-width=&quot;400&quot; data-github=&quot;aleksandar-todorovic/alan-turing&quot; class=&quot;github-card&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Sure, you might be satisfied with the courses your college is offering. But what if you’re not? What if you want to improve it? What if you want to learn some skill that your college is not offering as a part of their program?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We used to be limited by the courses our colleges are offering  us. Sure, if we wanted to learn something new and exciting, we could always buy a book or two and learn a new skill. But, thanks to the Internet, now there is a better way to learn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-mit-challenge&quot;&gt;The MIT Challenge&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MIT Challenge is a project by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scotthyoung.com/&quot;&gt;Scott H. Young&lt;/a&gt; that he started in 2011. Explained as short as possible, he tried to replicate MIT’s 4-year Computer Science Curriculum using courses offered by the MIT itself on their &lt;a href=&quot;http://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm&quot;&gt;OpenCourseWare platform&lt;/a&gt;. He managed to successfully replicate a curriculum that’s nearly identical to the curriculum offered by the MIT, and he managed to learn the four year curriculum in a year! For more details, see &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/mit-challenge/&quot;&gt;his blog post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, you might argue that he didn’t finish MIT program &lt;em&gt;per se&lt;/em&gt;, and you will be right. He did not get an actual diploma from MIT, he never even visited MIT, he graded himself and he did not enjoy any other privileges offered by the MIT as a part of their program. But what he did do is he managed to learn pretty much everything offered by the MIT in under a year for a price that’s &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; less expensive than actually going to MIT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/piSLobJfZ3c&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When he started the challenge, he believed that the diploma is overrated in todays world (something I completely agree with). It gave him a unique perspective on learning and education, as he said to me in an email response. As far as he knows, nobody was able to replicate his project so far. He proved to himself that he’s capable of doing a lot more than he used to think. He was not interested in an MIT diploma. What he &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; interested in was the Computer Science, and he (in his own words) managed to learn a great deal of Computer Science and he perfected his programming skills. Of course, if he wanted to specialize in something, he’d probably need more specific training in that field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His idea might be a little extreme, but he might be up to something. He encouraged me to look at my college curriculum from a critical point of view. This is why I have decided to improve my curriculum a little bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-situation-in-bosnia--herzegovina&quot;&gt;The Situation in Bosnia &amp;amp; Herzegovina&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I talk about a way for you to improve your curriculum, I kind of wanted to tell you a short story of why I have decided to so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’re probably aware that Bosnia &amp;amp; Herzegovina is not very familiar as a country with a good higher education. Here, there’s a constant debate whether or not young people should go to private or state colleges. State colleges are a little overrated and private colleges are considered a joke that anyone is capable of finishing. And I’m not blaming them, because they’re right in 90% of cases. It is nearly impossible to get a job in my country if you finish a private college in, lets say, law, medicine, or economics, and there’s a good reason for that. But the situation is quite different if you’re learning Computer Science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My college is pretty small and unknown even in my country. We only have about 150 students (in all years), our college staff is pretty small (I would say that my college has less than 30 employees), and we don’t actually have the comfort of choosing subjects that we’re going to take.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though our teachers are learning us the knowledge needed to get a job right after getting a college diploma, we are constantly limited to use a certain tool or to follow a certain path to the solution to a problem. Most of the students are comfortable with it, but I am not, mostly because I don’t feel comfortable with being obliged to use Microsoft’s tools to get the job done (I’m not saying that we’re using Microsoft’s tools &lt;em&gt;exclusively&lt;/em&gt;, but in most of the subjects they are a huge part of our curriculum).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what I need to do is to think outside of the box. I needed to find a way to learn specific things to pass my exams, but I also needed to be able to apply my theoretical knowledge in a wider area of situations, using the tools I’m comfortable with and learning the tools outside of my regular curriculum. So what I ended up doing is basically creating a Curriculum 2.0.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;presenting-you-curriculum-20&quot;&gt;Presenting You: Curriculum 2.0&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ve probably heard about Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) somewhere in the past and there’s a good reason for that: MOOCs are an easy way to learn about topics that you’re interested in by attending an online course offered by some of the biggest universities in the world. And there are thousands of them available on platforms like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coursera.org/&quot;&gt;Coursera&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.edx.org/&quot;&gt;Edx&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.udacity.com/&quot;&gt;Udacity&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.udemy.com/&quot;&gt;Udemy&lt;/a&gt;. Most of them are offered free of charge to anyone who’s interested in learning. All you need to do is to pay a small fee if you’re interested in getting a certificate as a way of proving that you’ve successfully finished them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But why not take it to another level, like Scott taught us? If you’re not satisfied with your course curriculum, why not taking an online course at the same time as your course in college? What you’ll end up doing is learning the same thing from two different sources. By doing so, you’re not obliged to follow a specific rule to get the job done. You can learn two or more ways of doing the same thing. You can become proficient in more programming languages then you’re going to learn in college. You can learn about algorithms from a wide variety of resources. What you’ll end up doing is passing the course and getting a certificate from two different universities for learning basically the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, this is not an easy task and you’ll run into lots of problems. You’ll have to learn to be proficient in your time management skills. You’ll have to study more and you’ll have to have a high level of productivity a day after day. I ended up taking a year off just to perfect my skills in areas where I thought I need to improve. But after going through all of this hustle, I finally think that I’m ready to incorporate all of that in my curriculum. In the meantime, I managed to improve my English proficiency, to practice my writing skills and to highly increase my level of productivity. I used to spend days without doing anything productive. Now, more than 50% of time I’m using my laptop is spent by doing something productive (and I know that thanks to this awesome freemuium service called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rescuetime.com/&quot;&gt;RescueTime&lt;/a&gt;). Sure, it is far from perfect, but I am improving &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt;. Half of a year later, I’m not regretting my decision to take a year off at all as I have only benefited by doing so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;so-whats-my-point&quot;&gt;So, What’s My Point?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to learn something new, you &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; always find the time to do that. If you want to learn a specific skill, there &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a MOOC that will teach you that. You &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; earn a bunch of certificates while you’re in a college. You can even get a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coursera.org/specializations&quot;&gt;specialization&lt;/a&gt; on Coursera or a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.udacity.com/nanodegree&quot;&gt;nanodegree&lt;/a&gt; on Udacity. And the best thing is, you can do all of this for free or by paying a pretty small fee that probably anyone could afford. If you’re passionate about learning, there’s nothing that could stop you.&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Artificial Intelligence is not only &lt;em&gt;going to&lt;/em&gt; change the world. It already &lt;em&gt;has&lt;/em&gt; changed the world. There’s a lot of difference between those two statements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To talk about this, first, we need to agree on what Artificial Intelligence really is. As with the pretty much every single topic that has ever existed, there are &lt;em&gt;plenty&lt;/em&gt; of different definitions on what AI really is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can consider AI to be a human-like robot that operates and thinks as a human, but you will be wrong. You can consider AI to be a computer with feelings, and you will, once again, be wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, lets start this article by defining AI as a hardware + software combination (or just a software) that takes the input data, processes it in some way that no human intelligence could ever be capable of doing, and then returns the output to the user. Now, you might argue with me that this definition does not represent AI and that it only represents what every single computer program is made for, but I think that you will be wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We currently do not have any all-purpose AI solution. What this means is that every algorithm and every robot is built with the specific purpose in mind. Take it and put it in some other environment, the one that the programmers and/or engineers haven’t thought of while they were building it, and you got yourself a pretty useless piece of software (+ hardware in some cases).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get back to the subject, I strongly think that AI is not something that &lt;em&gt;is going to&lt;/em&gt; change the future. I think that it already has. It is only going to increase the way it changes us and the world around us following the Moore’s law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Moore’s law is the observation that the power of the computer doubles approximately every two years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now there are some different definitions of how long does it take to the computer power to double. Some say that this process lasts only a year, some say that lasts 18 months, and others say that it lasts for two years. The point is that the computer power is increasing constantly at a &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; fast rate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;so-how-is-the-world-around-us-changed-with-the-ai&quot;&gt;So, how is the world around us changed with the AI?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, we all got smartphones in our pockets. I know, you’re probably tired of hearing this, but todays low-end smartphones &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; more powerful than the supercomputers we had as recently as 20 years ago, and we can’t even properly compare the physical size of them (one of them being as big as a room and the other being small enough to fit in a pocket). So, lets take Siri for an example. She is powerful, not powerful enough as a “regular” personal assistant (and by regular I mean human), but she is getting better and better. Her biggest flaw definitely is the speech recognition, which is quite a challenging topic in AI. It is a fine example of AI that runs &lt;em&gt;from your phone&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next example: Google Search. Long time ago, Google stopped offering all around search results and started memorizing what we searched for in the past and started using it to predict the topics we’re interested in searching. As an example, as you might already know, I have hosted my blog for almost six months using my &lt;a href=&quot;https://aleksandartodorovic.wordpress.com/&quot;&gt;Wordpress.com domain&lt;/a&gt;. After that, I have decided to ditch it and to start using my &lt;a href=&quot;http://r3bl.github.io/&quot;&gt;current domain&lt;/a&gt; together with Jekyll blogging platform. After I’ve started searching for some Jekyll tweaks and themes, I kept finding Wordpress tweaks as my top results. This type of AI is not easily recognizable, the search results vary only a little, but it is happening and you are using AI every time you use Google’s search provider. Try looking up your name from two different devices (both running different Google accounts) and see it for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next stop: Google Glass and Google’s self-driving vehicles. After that: that annoying Facebook algorithm that “predicts” people you should add to your friends based on your common interests, your location and with the interaction with your mutual friends. Face recognition? Of course, AI (and it is getting pretty good with it). YouTube video suggestions? Again, AI. Evernote tags? AI. Facebook timeline? AI. Cleverbot? (A pretty stupid use of) AI. Stock markets? We now have AI platforms that advises us which stocks should we buy and which stocks should we sell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You see, everything we do online &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; starting to be enhanced by AI. That line is not going to decrease over time, it is only going to increase at an exponential rate (as seen in the picture I showed as an example below).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.regentsprep.org/regents/math/algebra/AE7/fixpic2.gif&quot; alt=&quot;exponential growth&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;so-what-could-we-expect-in-the-near-future&quot;&gt;So, what could we expect in the near future?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ray Kurzweil is probably the biggest futurist alive. He has received 20 honorary doctorates and he has been awarded by three U.S. presidents. He published seven books, five of which have been national bestsellers. He already predicted some of our achievements and when they’re going to happen. He predicted that computers will be able to beat chess masters in (you guessed it) chess, that we will have WiFi broadly implemented across the world, that there will be self-driving vehicles reaching consumerism (OK, we still have a few years ahead of this, but does anyone really doubt it?), that we will find a way to project images right before our eyes… The list goes on and on. Following Moore’s law, he predicted even more amazing things in the next 25 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He predicts that we will be able to fight most of the known diseases by using nanobots. He predicts that the virtual reality is going to feel 100% real by the 2030s. He says that we will reach a point of singularity probably around 2029. He predicts that the line between the reality and the virtual reality is going to blur out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Singularity is the hypothesis that accelerating progress in technologies will cause a runaway effect wherein artificial intelligence will exceed human intellectual capacity and control, thus radically changing civilization in an event called the singularity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;will-ai-destoy-us&quot;&gt;Will AI destoy us?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is probably the most misleading statement in the field of AI. And it is pretty simple to figure out why. We have tons of movies with scenarios in which we created something so powerful that it considered us just as a threat and destroyed us. Take &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2209764/&quot;&gt;Transcendence (2014)&lt;/a&gt; as an example (although it doesn’t blindly follow that pattern). But I don’t think that anyone who knows something about AI agrees with it. You see, for the machine to become intelligent, first we need to program it. And I don’t think that anyone with the capacity of creating the real AI is going to try to dominate the world in any way. Our biggest bet probably relies on some huge company like IBM or Google, and I don’t think that they’re going to make such an awful mistake. Most of the AI scientissts and futurists agree with me on that. After all, the goal of AI is not to kill every potential buyer out there. The goal of creating AI is to create something that will exceed human intelligence and help us to find some answers to the questions we’re struggling with for a very long time.&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.marksanborn.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/learning-priorities-Development.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, this was actually not a part of my goals for 2015, but it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; something that I thought of in the meantime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love learning and I love dedicating my free time to learn something new. Currently, I’m really enjoying learning about artificial intelligence, which is definitely one of the most promising technology-related topics there is. I’m intrigued and amazed by every single new line that I read about it and I’m probably going to keep up with the learning of artificial intelligence for quite some time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, today, it got me wondered, why not pledge to learn something new every single day?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I really mean &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;single&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;day&lt;/em&gt;. No breaks, no vacations, no nothing. I love learning and I have developed a habit of learning something new at least once a week. So, why don’t I kick it up a notch?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting from today (well, actually, I have been learning something new for a few days in a row now), I’ve decided to learn something new every single day out of the topics I’m interested in. I’ve devoted my last month into getting quite a lot of books that are interesting to me, so now, I’m going to start reading them a day after day. One page a day is better than none.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to build a healthy habit that could help me throughout my career and this is the way of accomplishing it I’m completely comfortable with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, starting from today, you can expect me to push at least one commit to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/aleksandar-todorovic/notes/&quot;&gt;my notes repository&lt;/a&gt; every day. That repository already has over 5,000 words written in it and the list is only going to get bigger and bigger as I’m going to research as much interesting topics as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the weekends, I’m going to review my notes from the previous week, simplifying them and shortening them if needed. After I start to organize my time in an efficient way, I’m going to start to &lt;a href=&quot;http://ejohn.org/blog/write-code-every-day/&quot;&gt;write code every day&lt;/a&gt;, and, in a couple of months, I should know much more than I know currently in a wide variety of topics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I should emphasize that my goal is not to become an expert in a specific topic. My goal is to have a reasonable amount of knowledge in every single topic I can think of. My goal is to stop asking myself how something works. My goal is to start &lt;em&gt;learning&lt;/em&gt; how something works on a daily basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who knows, if I work &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; hard, I might even be able to get a summer internship in some company that I deeply admire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of the post, I’m going to share my short-term goals with the public, to make sure that I make them a reality and to get an even higher inspiration:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pass every subject from my first semester in the first half of February (two of them left, my finals are starting in five days).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Start the coding challenge that I’ve mentioned before by the end of February.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pass every subject from my second semester by the end of the first half of April (again, only two of them left).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Have a decent amount of knowledge in artificial intelligence by the end of May.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Have a decent amount of proficiency in C / C++ / Vala by the end of June.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m going to update this post every time I accomplish a goal I stated here by adding a check mark (✓) next to it. And, of course, every time I learn something interesting worthy of posting, I will put an update my blog.&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Počeo sam da sumnjam kada sam krenuo u prvi razred srednje škole. Išao sam u poprilično jedno-religijsku osnovnu školu, i poslije toga sam se preselio u Brčko, poznato kao jedan od rijetkih gradova gdje sve tri nacionalnosti iz BiH živi zajedno. U početku savršeno, kasnije noćna mora. Iako se ljudi prave da nema podjele, srednjoškolci jedne nacionalnosti idu u jedan kafić, srednjoškolci druge u drugi kafić, srednjoškolci treće vjere u treći kafić. I to je postalo sasvim normalno. Da se razumijemo, ne kažem da su svi posjetioci ta tri kafića koje pominjem bili te vjere, ali procenat je poprilično ogroman da bi se zanemario.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Odbijajući da se ograničim na to sa kojim ću se ljudima družiti na osnovu njihove religije, često sam bio kritikovan i odbacivan od “svojih” ljudi. Zbog te odbačenosti na neki način, počeo sam da dobijam averziju prema svojoj vjeri i u “hakerskom” duhu, krenuo sam da istražujem. Na jedan papir sam u dvije kolone napisao usporedbe o određenim shvatanjima iz Biblije sa znanstvenim zaključcima. Shvatio sam da se ne slažem sa mnogo stvari iz Biblije, i kao neko ko je zapravo pročitao Bibliju (budimo realni, većina vjernika je nikada i ne pročita), postao sam svjestan da ljudi citate uzimaju iz konteksta, uzimajući ono što im odgovara, odbacujući dijelove Biblije koji im ne odgovaraju. To je po meni bilo pogrešno. Ne možeš jedan dio svete knjige da poštuješ, drugi ne. Ili idi na sve, ili ne idi na ništa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Presudan trenutak je za mene bio jedan sasvim običan dan kada sam gledao jedan od nastupa preminulog komičara George Carlin-a. Onda je došao ovaj dio, koji je bukvalno bio okidač u mom slučaju. Preko noći, prestao sam da ispitujem svoju religiju i odlučio da je odbacim. Proces “prelaska” je trajao čitavu moju srednju školu, a kada sam završio srednju školu, i taj proces je bio završen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;420&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/8r-e2NDSTuE&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Danas, skoro tri godine kasnije, trpim posljedice. Na popisu stanovništva u BiH, ispitivač je odbio da upiše Bosanac ateista kao moju nacionalnost i religiju. Nastala je svađa, i na kraju sam pod pritiskom od strane roditelja i popisivača ipak potpisao papir na kojem piše da sam Srbin pravoslavac, nešto čemu sam se strogo protivio u tom trenutku, i još uvijek se protivim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nedavno sam našao jednu prelijepu curu i zaljubio se. Prekinuli smo kada su njeni saznali moje ime i prezime, automatski misleći o meni da sam Srbin pravoslavac na osnovu imena, ni ne popričavši sa mnom i odbacujući svaku mogućnost da sam nešto drugačije od onoga šta moje ime predstavlja. Razlog zašto im moja (sada već bivša) cura nije rekla moje pravo opredjeljenje jeste zato što bi “bilo još gore” (pod navodnicima ne zato što se ne slažem sa rečenim, nego da stavim u konekst u kojem sam doživio te riječi).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Da se razumijemo, ovo nije prvi put da mi se to dogodilo i ovo je već četvrta ili peta veza koja se završila na potpuno isti način (opisan u pseudokodu koji će svako razumjeti):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;cura kaže roditeljima moje ime
povežu me sa nacijom i religijom
ukoliko je moja nacija drugačija od njene
    pritišću je na to da odustane
    ukoliko ona još uvijek zavisi od njih
        popušta pri pritisku.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Samo, ova me je do sada na neki način najviše pogodila, te za mene ostavila potrebu da se na neki način “istresem”, odlučio sam se za ovaj način.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dalje, posao. Primljen u kafić da konobarišem, kontao dobro će mi doći malo para sa strane, nema puno posla pa se mogu fokusirati na fakultet kada nema gostiju. Tokom godina, počevši od srednje pa do sada, naučio sam da se ne obazirem na imena. U početku mi je bilo čudno, vrlo čudno upoznati osobu koja se zove Emir, Aldina, Amar, Medina, Hajrudin, Albin, Edita i slično. U ovo vrijeme, počeo sam da ogluvljujem na imena, ne identifikovajući ih odma kao naciju i vjeru, nego isključivo kao osobu sa možda potpuno drugačijom pričom. Na tom poslu nisam ni primjetio da su su svi zaposleni, kao i šefovi i gosti koji dolaze tamo, zapravo svi jedne vjere. U prvoj prilici kada je to gazda napomenuo govoreći o konkurentnom kafiću kako ne može da vjeruje da neke osobe radije idu tamo nego ovdje (jer pobogu, tamo je gazda Bošnjak!), počeo sam da se oglušujem na naredbe i ubrzo dao otkaz, na pomalo nepredviđen način, ali dokazao sam da sa takvim osobama jednostavno ne mogu “poslovati” (malo grub termin uzimajući u obzir (ne)ozbiljnost ovog posla).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Danas se distanciram od ljudi koje smatram lošim, bez obzira na naciju i vjeru. Nisam ograničen nijednom “svetom knjigom”, te uživam u tome da čitam različite teorije na ovu temu, bez straha da ću zbog svoje radoznalosti biti mučen “do kraja vremena” (šta god taj pojam predstavljao). Imam dosta otvoreno društvo od 20ak ljudi koje jednostavno boli k… za religiju i naciju, te ih većina ili ima sumnje ili u potpunosti odbacuje svoju religiju, ipak poštujući one koji vjeruju.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Još jedna stvar koju mi je omogućio ovaj pritisak na mene od strane “mojih” i “onih ostalih” jeste taj da se prestanem toliko brinuti o mislima ostalih (u koje sada za mene spadaju i “moji” i “tuđi”) i da se fokusiram na lični uspjeh. Dok ja radim na sebi, oni pričaju o meni, stagnirajući na potpuno istom mjestu iz dana u dan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Poenta je: Uspio sam se osloboditi tih okova koje mi je društvo nametalo. Postao sam slobodan čovjek, istražujući i fokusirajući se na svoje znanje, odbijajući da prihvatim bilo kakvo ograničenje koje mi neko postavi. Doživljavam neke posljedice sa vremena na vrijeme zbog toga, međutim nema te posljedice koja može da nadmaši sve dobro što mi je sloboda donijela. Počevši sa vjerom, prešao sam i na druge stvari u životu, tako da sam sada uspješno izgradio svoje lično ja, koje je potpuno drugačije od društveno prihvatljive norme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Društvena norma je biti pripadnik neke vjere =&amp;gt; ja sam ateista.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Društvena norma je slušati narodnjake =&amp;gt; ja partijam vikendima i na neki način se i bavim elektronskom muzikom.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Društvena norma je biti ograničen na Windows =&amp;gt; ja sam zakleti Linux-aš.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dakle, za mene je odbacivanje vjere bio jedan (a i najvažniji) od koraka koje sam prešao pri kreiranju svoje ličnosti, odbacujući ono što drugi žele od mene i fokusirajući se na to šta ja želim od sebe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Na kraju, želim da citiram sam sebe (koliko god to glupo zvučalo) tako što što ću navesti jednu rečenicu koju obožavam da izgovaram:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Možda nisam najljepši, možda nisam najzgodniji, možda imam svoje poroke, međutim, imam mozak i znam kako da ga iskoristim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

  <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Wordpress was a great platform for the beginning of my blogging experience. The simplicity needed for the creation and maintaining of the Wordpress blog is amazing. It literally took me 10 minutes from the creation of my blog to my first post. But, a few days ago, I’ve decided that it is time for me to switch to something more powerful. I’ve decided to switch to Jekyll blogging platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;why-have-i-chosen-github--jekyll-as-my-new-platform&quot;&gt;Why have I chosen GitHub + Jekyll as my new platform?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, first of all, my PHP knowledge is &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; limited. I have always considered PHP to be the weakest spot in my education. And, on top of that, I’m not that comfortable with databases for now. Jekyll has allowed me to run a completely self-maintained blog without using any PHP or MySQL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;using-this-combo-is-going-to-boost-my-github-profile-and-my-git-knowledge&quot;&gt;Using this combo is going to boost my GitHub profile &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; my Git knowledge&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of the excellent Jekyll integration with GitHub pages, maintaining a blog using Jekyll is going to force me to use GitHub even more than I have used it so far. And I think that is great. By doing so, I’m going to visit GitHub more often, which will boost my desire to hack and program new things (&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/personal-assistant/pa-wiki#personal-assistant&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; is the newest project I’m planing on making a reality).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will also boost my GitHub profile in the search results, which is something I desperately need to do. While Google-ing my full name, I found out that there’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0865390/&quot;&gt;an actor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://aleksandartodorovic.com/&quot;&gt;a photographer&lt;/a&gt; and a war criminal with the same name as mine. You can imagine the surprise of my future employer if he sees my name associated with a term such as a war criminal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;i-love-every-single-product-that-github-developed-over-the-years&quot;&gt;I love every single product that GitHub developed over the years&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lets be honest, &lt;a href=&quot;http://r3bl.github.io/en/why-github-is-my-favorite-company/&quot;&gt;GitHub is my favorite company&lt;/a&gt; and I love every single feature they’ve developed over the years. I love their tight integration with Git,  their pages, their Gists, their &lt;a href=&quot;http://atom.io/&quot;&gt;Atom text editor&lt;/a&gt; and their &lt;a href=&quot;https://education.github.com/pack&quot;&gt;Student Developer Pack&lt;/a&gt; (even though my request is still in the verification process).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;markdown-has-become-my-favorite-markup-language&quot;&gt;Markdown has become my favorite markup language&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ever since I’ve started using GitHub more regularly, I’m amazed by the simplicity behind Markdown. I’m using it to type everything from by blog posts to my collage papers and essays. Now, to be honest, I’ve written most of my posts using Markdown even back when in my Wordpress days, but Jekyll allows me to update my blog in an incredibly simple way. I just have to write my post inside of a new Markdown file, update my repository and that’s it. I don’t even have to open Firefox to post something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;an-option-to-choose-a-commenting-platform&quot;&gt;An option to choose a commenting platform&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lets be honest, if you need comments on your website, Disqus is the way to go. Most of the sites I’m visiting are using it, and I see no reason of why I should choose anything else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;i-love-having-the-full-control-over-my-blog&quot;&gt;I love having the full control over my blog&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Worpress.com is a free platform and as such it does have some advantages and some limitations. Even though I loved the simplicity of some feature (like a Wordpress stats feature), I hated the way I was limited in the customization of my blog. Using this combination, I have no limitation that I’m uncomfortable with. I can customize my blog in any way I want and it feels great! Every Jekyll customization, every theme and every plugin I ran into were completely free (as in both speech &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; beer) and because of that I can customize every single aspect of them as I wish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;so-how-will-i-make-the-transition-happen&quot;&gt;So, how will I make the transition happen?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now this is a tricky one. I &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; decided that I’m going to be using this combination permanently, but I &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; have a lot of work to do before making the final switch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, there are still some parts of this excellent &lt;a href=&quot;https://mmistakes.github.io/hpstr-jekyll-theme/&quot;&gt;HPSTR Jekyll theme&lt;/a&gt; that I haven’t customized properly (or &lt;em&gt;at all&lt;/em&gt;). This is why I’m regularly updating a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/r3bl/r3bl.github.io/blob/master/TODO.md&quot;&gt;TODO.md&lt;/a&gt; file to remind myself of what still needs to be done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, if you like my blog, I encourage you to go through that TODO.md file and to report any issues that I haven’t noticed inside of that file &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/r3bl/r3bl.github.io/issues&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, I’m going to post on &lt;a href=&quot;https://aleksandartodorovic.wordpress.com/&quot;&gt;my old platform&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://r3bl.github.io/&quot;&gt;my new platform&lt;/a&gt; until I’m completely satisfied with the switch. I have also started posting my most interesting articles on Medium not too long ago, so you might want to &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@r3bl&quot;&gt;check that out&lt;/a&gt; as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can expect some great new things like SSL support, my own domain and a fully customized home page in the near future. And, in the spirit of open source software, every single line of code &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/r3bl/r3bl.github.io&quot;&gt;is available&lt;/a&gt; for you to fork and use in your project in any way you want.&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The edited version of this article is posted on &lt;a href=&quot;http://opensource.com/&quot;&gt;Opensource.com&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=&quot;http://opensource.com/life/15/2/beginners-guide-github&quot;&gt;A beginner’s guide to GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this post I’m going to share with you a few reasons why I consider GitHub as my favorite technology-related company. If you still don’t know what GitHub is, you should continue reading this article because I’m going to share with you some of the most popular features GitHub has integrated in their service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://aleksandartodorovic.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/github_logo.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://aleksandartodorovic.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/github_logo.png?w=300&quot; alt=&quot;GitHub logo&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-github&quot;&gt;What is GitHub?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;GitHub is a web-based Git repository hosting service, which offers all of the distributed revision control and source code management (SCM) functionality of Git as well as adding its own features.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the definition I borrowed from a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub&quot;&gt;GitHub Wikipedia article&lt;/a&gt;. In short terms, it’s a place where every developer (or a student soon-to-be developer like me) can share their source code and their stories with the world. It’s a huge and highly respected collaboration platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s been used by every big technology company you can think of. Let me give you a few examples: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/google&quot;&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/twitter&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.mozilla.org/Github&quot;&gt;Mozilla&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://microsoft.github.io/&quot;&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://code.facebook.com/projects/&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://adobe.github.io/&quot;&gt;Adobe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://ibm.github.io/&quot;&gt;IBM&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/yahoo&quot;&gt;Yahoo!&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/linkedin&quot;&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://netflix.github.io/&quot;&gt;Netflix&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/dropbox&quot;&gt;Dropbox&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/paypal&quot;&gt;PayPal&lt;/a&gt;. Still think GitHub doesn’t have a huge support? What if I told you that &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/WhiteHouse&quot;&gt;White House&lt;/a&gt; uses it too? I bet you didn’t know that some of these organizations even participate in the open source community at all!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, why have they all chosen GitHub as a platform?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-great-place-to-store-your-code&quot;&gt;A Great Place to Store Your Code&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s be honest, today, if you’re not hosting your source code on GitHub, your open source project does not exist. I have a lot of respect for other solutions such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://launchpad.net/&quot;&gt;Launchpad&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://bitbucket.org/&quot;&gt;BitBucket&lt;/a&gt;, but lets be honest, GitHub is the place to go if you need a place to share your source code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;huge-developer-community&quot;&gt;Huge Developer Community&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;There are 8.2M people collaborating right now across 19M repositories on GitHub. Developers from all around the world are building amazing things together. Their story is our story.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I borrowed this quote from GitHub’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/about&quot;&gt;press page&lt;/a&gt;. Over &lt;em&gt;eight million people&lt;/em&gt; is not a small number, and they’ve all chosen GitHub as their choice. Together, they’ve created around 19 million repositories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;github-as-a-replacement-for-linkedin&quot;&gt;GitHub as a Replacement for LinkedIn&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t get me wrong, I love LinkedIn and I’m using it myself for quite some time (you can find my LinkedIn profile &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/aleksandartodorovic&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). But the truth is, you can post pretty much anything you want on LinkedIn and you can perfect your profile in any way you want. GitHub does not allow you to do the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;everything-you-publish-on-github-you-prove-it-right-away&quot;&gt;Everything you publish on GitHub, you prove it right away.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an example, lets say that you posted on LinkedIn that you know how to program using C++. Your connections can endorse your skill and your employer can be sure that you know how to program using C++ if enough of your connections endorse it. But, if he visits your GitHub profile, he can see your C++ knowledge in action. He can read the code you’ve posted and based on the code, he can make sure that you’re a creative and a collaborative person, and that you have an experience in working with C++.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now don’t get me wrong, your GitHub is not a replacement for your resume and you should not think of it as a replacement for your resume. &lt;strong&gt;But&lt;/strong&gt;, it is a place where you can show your skills instead of talking about them. And there are some projects like &lt;a href=&quot;https://osrc.dfm.io/&quot;&gt;Open Source Report Card&lt;/a&gt; that grabs your public GitHub data and represents them in a way that’s pretty similar to a resume (check out my Open Source Report Card &lt;a href=&quot;https://osrc.dfm.io/aleksandar-todorovic/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;github-pages&quot;&gt;GitHub Pages&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, let’s say that you want to build a website that represents you, your organization, your company, or anything else. You have a couple of options. You can buy your own domain and hosting service and build it from scratch. You can choose some freemium service like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wix.com/&quot;&gt;Wix&lt;/a&gt;, where you will create a stunning website in minutes without any coding knowledge, but you will be limited to the features that service allows you to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, lets say that you want to have a full control over your site, &lt;em&gt;without&lt;/em&gt; any limitations what so ever, &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; you showcase your website development and design skills in the process, all of that &lt;em&gt;completely free of charge&lt;/em&gt;. The solution? &lt;a href=&quot;https://pages.github.com/&quot;&gt;GitHub Pages&lt;/a&gt;! You can create your personal website, a website for your organization or a website for your project straight away. And it’s not really complicated to do that. Don’t believe me? Check out my &lt;a href=&quot;http://aleksandar-todorovic.github.io/&quot;&gt;online portfolio&lt;/a&gt;! It took me less than 15 minutes to create it using a template offered by GitHub, and I have a full control of that website, which explains how I managed to alter the design of the template called Hack by &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/bleikamp&quot;&gt;Ben Bleikamp&lt;/a&gt; (see how original template looks like &lt;a href=&quot;http://sundaykofax.github.io/baby-legs/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;github-training&quot;&gt;GitHub Training&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GitHub uses Git, which is a distributed revision control system designed and developed by Linus Torvalds for Linux kernel development back in 2005. It has become the most widely adopted version cotrol system for software development there is (&lt;a href=&quot;https://ianskerrett.wordpress.com/2014/06/23/eclipse-community-survey-2014-results/&quot;&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, lets say that you don’t know how to work with Git, the same way I didn’t know how how to work with Git not too long ago. Problem? Heck no! All resources for working with Git using GitHub as a platform are already provided for you by GitHub itself! GitHub offers you free resources (or training kits as they call them) &lt;a href=&quot;https://training.github.com/kit/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and you also have a few free online courses available &lt;a href=&quot;https://training.github.com/classes/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Whatever learning option you choose to use out of those provided, you’ll see that your materials are divided in three difficulties: beginner/foundations, intermediate or advanced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;github-gists&quot;&gt;GitHub Gists&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the newest addition to the GitHub services. It’s a place where you’re able to share your text or a part of your code publicly (which means that your gist will be searchable by a search engine and viewed from your profile) or privately (which means that only people you choose are going to be able to view it, and you share Gists with them by simply copying a link).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;atom-text-editor&quot;&gt;Atom Text Editor&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After I found out about &lt;a href=&quot;https://atom.io/&quot;&gt;Atom&lt;/a&gt;, I fell in love with GitHub all over again. Atom is a hackable text editor for the 21st Century (as advertised by GitHub).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, a hackable text editor, what does that even mean?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That means that you can hack every single thing inside of that text editor. Don’t know how? Not to worry, there are thousands of packages &lt;a href=&quot;https://atom.io/packages&quot;&gt;already available&lt;/a&gt;, all of them hosted on GitHub and offered free of charge. Don’t like the design of the editor? Pick your favorite flavor of Atom out of thousands of them available &lt;a href=&quot;https://atom.io/themes&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. You can customize your installation to be anything from a simple text editor to a full IDE (short for Integrated Development Environment). Heck, you can even write your publications, your blog posts or your books in it. In fact, I even used it to write the post you’re currently reading (see the picture below) in the same way I’m using it to write every single post on &lt;a href=&quot;https://aleksandartodorovic.wordpress.com/&quot;&gt;my blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://aleksandartodorovic.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/screenshot-from-2015-01-25-024501.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://aleksandartodorovic.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/screenshot-from-2015-01-25-024501.png?w=300&quot; alt=&quot;Picture of how I wrote this post&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;github-student-developer-pack&quot;&gt;GitHub Student Developer Pack&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is something I recently discovered. A few days ago, I got a letter from my collage professor stating that as a student, I’m eligible to get a &lt;a href=&quot;https://education.github.com/pack&quot;&gt;GitHub Student Developer Pack&lt;/a&gt;, which offers me over 15 free and paid development tools from GitHub and its partners at a huge discount. Now, I should point out that I’m still in the verification process at the time this article is published. This process could last for weeks! But, I should also point out that a guy called Alex Fernandez from GitHub staff has personally apologized to me for that. The reason why this process lasts for so long is because they have to review each request manually, which does take quite some time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://aleksandartodorovic.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/github-mark-64px.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://aleksandartodorovic.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/github-mark-64px.png&quot; alt=&quot;GitHub-Mark-64px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;github-has-an-amazing-support&quot;&gt;GitHub Has an Amazing Support&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m a developer. I use a lot of stable and unstable software and services on a daily basis and it is important to me to get the support as fast as possible. I had an issue with a certain GitHub feature so I decided to contact &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/contact&quot;&gt;GitHub support&lt;/a&gt;. I’ve got an email response in like 20 minutes, and they’ve been very helpful in the process. They’ve managed to explain to me why I had this issue and what I had to do to resolve it. I have to give them a straight 10/10 for their support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;so-if-you-are-a-developer-is-there-a-reason-not-to-use-github&quot;&gt;So, if you are a developer, is there a reason &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to use GitHub?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Honestly, I don’t think there is. If you’re developing a proprietary software, there are plenty of reasons why you should not post the source code of your application on GitHub. But, that should not stop you from working on open source software in your free time. By doing so, it will benefit you (once you start looking for a new job), it will benefit the developers behind a project that you’ve decided to be a part of, and it will benefit every single user of that open source project. GitHub offers you a wide variety of opportunities and you should take advantage of them!&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Across my Reddit feed, I came up with this great article titled &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wiseism.com/write-personal-manifesto/&quot;&gt;Why You Should Write a Personal Manifesto&lt;/a&gt;, published by &lt;a href=&quot;http://wiseism.com/&quot;&gt;Wiseism&lt;/a&gt;. I feel like this is a great way to keep yourself motivated, so I’ve decided to do just that: to write down my own manifesto.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m pretty confident that this manifesto really represents who I truly am, so I’ve decided to share it with you guys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of the post, there’s a picture with the manifesto that I made because I wanted to use it as my wallpaper. From time to time, I really enjoy reading &lt;a href=&quot;http://phrack.org/issues/7/3.html&quot;&gt;Hacker’s Manifesto&lt;/a&gt;, and I made this Manifesto to replace that occasional reading with something I wrote myself. This Manifesto is not new, it’s saved on my computer for a long time now and I had a different reason to write it. After reading this article, I’ve just rearranged it a little to look more “manifestish” (whatever that means).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h1 id=&quot;my-manifesto&quot;&gt;My Manifesto&lt;/h1&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;I’m not like most of you.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;I do not have emotions. I don’t feel the same way as most people feel. I don’t get hurt easily. I don’t believe I’m going to go to hell if I do something. I don’t believe I should be forbidden to do something I would like to do.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;I’m not a role model of any kind and I’m not trying to be a role model to anyone. I’ve tried most of the things people consider bad. I don’t think that anyone could help me if I don’t want to help myself. I don’t believe anyone will be by my side until death do as apart. I realize I’m on my own in this world and that’s the way I like to live my life.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;When I meet someone, all I see is a game. A game that I can win or loose. I don’t get attached to people, all I see is a way to exploit them. A way to manipulate them to get what I want. And you know what I want? I want to be happy. And I am just that.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;You wanna know why? Because I have something that most of the people surrounding me do not have. I have my mind and I know how to use it. I know how to make the best out of any situation and I’m perfectly happy in every situation I can possibly run into. I’m not saying I’m any more intelligent that you. I’m not saying that I think of myself as some higher species than most of the people. I’m not saying I’ve read more books than you. I’m just saying that I know how to be happy. I know how to feel alive…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PNG version:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://aleksandartodorovic.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/manifesto.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://aleksandartodorovic.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/manifesto.png?w=300&quot; alt=&quot;manifesto&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The font used in the picture is my new favorite font called Ubuntu Mono. If you like the design used in this picture, you should thank &lt;a href=&quot;tombr.de&quot;&gt;Tom Brewe&lt;/a&gt; (GitHub username: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/nylki&quot;&gt;nylki&lt;/a&gt;) for creating this awesome syntax theme for &lt;a href=&quot;http://atom.io/&quot;&gt;Atom&lt;/a&gt; called &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/nylki/pen-paper-coffee-syntax&quot;&gt;pen-paper-coffee-syntax&lt;/a&gt;. The wallpaper is basically a screenshot of the text (using that syntax theme and Ubuntu Mono font) slightly edited using GIMP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m also thinking about creating a dark version of the wallpaper. If I decide to make it, I will update this post immediately.&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;httpwwwcognitivebrandscomcreativeintelligencewp-contentuploads201408socialnetworksdepositphotos13876565xs-1jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.cognitivebrands.com/CreativeIntelligence/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/SocialNetworksDepositphotos_13876565_xs-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;uvod&quot;&gt;Uvod&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U ovom tekstu neću da pričam o statistici. U koliko vas zanimaju statistike o tome koliko se koja društvena mreža koristi, vrlo lako ćete pronaći sve potrebne podatke na internetu. U ovom tekstu ću da objasnim kako mladi u mojoj lokalnoj zajednici koriste koju društvenu mrežu, gledajući prvenstveno svoje vlastito iskustvo i iskustvo mojih prijatelja (onih van društvenih mreža).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ta-smatram-pod-pojmom-mladi&quot;&gt;Šta smatram pod pojmom mladi?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pod pojmom mladi u ovom tekstu smatram osobe između 16 i 20 godina. Dakle osobe stare da bi se nazivale tinejdžerima, ali premlade da bi se shvatile ozbiljno u svijetu odraslih osoba.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;facebook&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sve više se primjeti da Facebook gubi moć među mojim prijateljima i poznanicima. Većina ga koristi samo zbog &lt;em&gt;chat&lt;/em&gt; opcije, koja je mnogo zastupljenija od bilo koje druge IM opcije. Primjeti se da sve manje ljudi objavljuje statuse. Objave se većinom svode na postavljanje novih fotografija, koje u većini slučajeva budu dijeljene sa Instagrama. Takođe se primjeti i da sve manje ljudi iz ove populacije zapravo čita početnu stranicu, te su korisnici sada većinom fokusirani na Facebook grupe, prvenstveno zbog toga što tu nema filtriranja vijesti. Korisnici sve više odustaju od objavljivanja sadržaja baš zbog tih algoritama. Vrlo je teško da će neki vaš &lt;em&gt;post&lt;/em&gt; postati popularan ako ništa prije toga niste objavili u posljednjih mjesec dana. Potrebna je predanost i aktivnost da bi bili čitani. Zbog toga je većina mojih prijatelja počela da traži alternativne metode da bi bili čitani.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Koristi ga oko 95% osoba koje poznajem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;twitter&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Twitter je vrlo specijalna društvena mreža na našim prostorima. Nema ogroman broj korisnika među nama, međutim oni koji ga koriste, to rade u ogromnim količinama. Provođenje nekoliko sati bez prestanka čitajući “lajnu” i postavljajući tvitove je postala sasvim normalna stvar. Uopšteno, ljudi ga koriste kao neku vrstu dnevnika, sa određenom dozom želje za pažnjom i sticanja “uticajnosti”, slike su rijetkost, a većina ljudi koje poznajem ne koriste svoj pravi identitet prilikom korišćenja ove društvene mreže, te se zbog tih razloga mnogo češće susrećemo sa govorima mržnje nego na ostalim društvenim mrežama. Govori mržnje su prvenstveno fokusirani protiv pojedinaca koji ne koriste ovu društvenu mrežu. Međutim, ukoliko mislite da bi se uklanjanjem anonimnosti riješio govor mržnje, želim da vas podsjetim da &lt;a href=&quot;https://aleksandartodorovic.wordpress.com/2014/12/04/anonimnost-nije-rjesenje/&quot;&gt;uklanjanje anonimnosti nije rješenje&lt;/a&gt; za borbu protiv govora mržnje. Evidentno je i da je novoj osobi koja se pridruži ovoj mreži potrebna ogromna količina truda da bi bila prihvaćena od strane “iskusnijih” tviteraša.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Koristi ga oko 50% osoba koje poznajem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;tumblr&quot;&gt;Tumblr&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nešto između vlastitog bloga i Twitter profila je upravo Tumblr. Mjesto gdje osobe koje poznajem pronalaze inspiraciju, maštaju o nekom idealnom životu, te objavljuju uopšteno slike stvari koje im se sviđaju. Početna na Tumblr-u je obično prepuna slika, a kao ultimativni razlog zašto se toliki broj mojih prijatelja i poznanika okreće upravo ovoj društevnoj mreži ispred vođenja vlastitog bloga smatram lakoću vođenja bloga preko repostovanja stvari koje nam se sviđaju.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Koristi ga oko 20% osoba koje poznajem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;instagram&quot;&gt;Instagram&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ne koristim ovu društvenu mrežu i, da budem iskren, ne razumijem u potpunosti poentu ove društvene mreže, međutim sasvim je očigledno da ovaj servis sve veći broj mojih Facebook prijatelja koristi kao način za dijeljenje fotografija na Facebook-u.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Koristi ga oko 40% osoba koje poznajem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;gag&quot;&gt;9gag&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iako cilj ovog sajta nije da postane društvena mreža, evidentno je da uvođenjem 9gag profila i količinom komentara ispod svakog viralnog posta 9gag ide prema tom pravcu. Posjetioci 9gag-a se u velikoj mjeri drže zajedno i vrlo je lako novoj osobi da postane dio te zajednice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Koristi ga oko 20% osoba koje poznajem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;reddit&quot;&gt;Reddit&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Poznajem još samo dvije osobe koje su aktivne na Reddit-u. Iako vrlo nepopularan među osobama koje poznajem, evidentno je da ga osobe koje ga koriste koriste u vrlo velikoj mjeri. Smatra se vrlo “zrelom” socijalnom mrežom, sa mnogo konstruktivnih i objektivnih rasprava o trenutno aktuelnim temama.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;vlastiti-blogovi&quot;&gt;Vlastiti blogovi&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ova metoda društvene pripadnosti je vrlo rijetka među mojim poznanicima. Pored mene, poznajem još samo dvije osobe koje vode svoj blog, međutim, za razliku od mene, te dvije osobe svoj blog vode anonimno, bez želje da ih čitaju ljudi ih poznaju van društvenih mreža.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;zakljuak&quot;&gt;Zaključak&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Smatram da je za uspijeh neke društvene mreže vrlo važno uzeti u obzir način na koji bi ga potencijali korisnici koristili. Iako je bitno ponuditi nešto novo korisnicima, vrlo je evidentno i da korisnici neće prihvatiti tu društvenu mrežu ukoliko je ne počne koristiti određena doza poznanika.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Takođe, evidentno je i da društvene mreže koje su bazirane na to da budu ultimativno rješenje za vođenje društvenog života počinju da propadaju, što bih naveo kao razlog sve većeg nezadovoljstva korišćenjem Facebook-a i potpunoj propasti Google+-a kao društvene mreže. Moglo bi se reći da moji poznanici pri korišćenju društvenih mreža prate Linux filozofiju, tako što traže jedan servis preko kojeg će da rade tačno određeni zadatak umjesto da koriste ultimativna društvena rješenja.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Napomena&lt;/strong&gt;: Tekst je napisan po uzori na &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/backchannel/a-teenagers-view-on-social-media-1df945c09ac6&quot;&gt;ovaj tekst&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In this post, I’m going to share with you a couple of programs / web services / apps that I’ve started using regularly in 2014. I’ve discovered some of them in 2013, but in 2014 I really started to use them on a regular basis. I hope that you will find something for yourself in my list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;best-operating-system-elementary-os-freyahttpelementaryosorg&quot;&gt;Best operating system: &lt;a href=&quot;http://elementaryos.org/&quot;&gt;elementary OS Freya&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been using elementary OS since 2013. But it definitely became my primary operating system in 2014. I haven’t used Windows in months now and I’m not missing anything. Plus, It’s a real joy participating in the development since the release of Beta 1 version. I’m also &lt;a href=&quot;https://aleksandartodorovic.wordpress.com/2014/11/11/elementary-os-bosnian-language/&quot;&gt;translating elementary OS to Bosnian language&lt;/a&gt; in my free time. Too bad I haven’t finished my job by the end of 2014, but I think that the translation is pretty much usable by now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;best-text-editor-atomhttpsatomio&quot;&gt;Best text editor: &lt;a href=&quot;https://atom.io/&quot;&gt;Atom&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a hackable text editor for the 21st century, as advertised by worldly-known &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;. I’ve been using it for a couple of months and loving every single aspect of it. In fact, I’m writing this and every single other article in it using Markdown as a styling language before posting them to Wordpress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;best-productivity-apps-todotxthttptodotxtcom-gitithttpgititnet-and-rescuetimehttprescuetimecom&quot;&gt;Best productivity apps: &lt;a href=&quot;http://todotxt.com/&quot;&gt;Todo.txt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://gitit.net/&quot;&gt;Gitit&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://rescuetime.com/&quot;&gt;RescueTime&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been using &lt;a href=&quot;http://evernote.com/&quot;&gt;Evernote&lt;/a&gt; for a couple of months, but the clunky interface of the desktop version for Windows and the fact that there is no official Linux client really started to annoy me big time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I’ve started looking for the alternatives and Todo.txt in a combination with Gitit looks like a perfect alternative to me. So, what I’ve started doing is writing my notes inside a wiki that I’m running on my local machine (using Gitit as a platform).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m using Todo.txt as my to-do list natively in Linux using &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mNantern/QTodoTxt&quot;&gt;QTodoTxt&lt;/a&gt; and so far it works great! Been using it for a couple of months now and I see no reason why I won’t be using it throughout 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RescueTime is not really a productivity app. It’s more of a way to see how productive you are really. With the native application running in the background, I can see how much of my time has been spent doing something productive. Native Linux client and Firefox add-on are a perfect combination for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;best-tools-for-communication-pidginhttppidginim-my-bloghttpsaleksandartodorovicwordpresscom-and-twitterhttpstwittercomr3bl&quot;&gt;Best tools for communication: &lt;a href=&quot;http://pidgin.im/&quot;&gt;Pidgin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aleksandartodorovic.wordpress.com/&quot;&gt;my blog&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/r3bl_&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m really loving the way Pidgin is integrated in my operating system. I’ve been using it since 2013, but now I’m using it exclusively to chat with my Facebook friends. In fact, I’m opening Facebook no more than once a day now, which means that most of my time is spent doing something a little bit more productive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really found myself in the management of this blog. I’m enjoying every second of writing stuff for my audience and I’m pretty satisfied with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://aleksandartodorovic.wordpress.com/2015/01/01/blog-stats-2014/&quot;&gt;support I’m getting from you guys&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Twitter has been my primary social network since the end of the 2013. But, in 2014, I’ve started running two Twitter profiles, one personal, and one for my business communications. I’ve managed to bond with some awesome people and learn a lot by reading articles other people are suggesting to me through their Twitter feed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;best-cloud-service-megahttpsmegaconz&quot;&gt;Best cloud service: &lt;a href=&quot;https://mega.co.nz/&quot;&gt;MEGA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although I have 1 TB of space on &lt;a href=&quot;http://onedrive.live.com/&quot;&gt;OneDrive&lt;/a&gt; and one more TB of space in &lt;a href=&quot;https://cloud.mail.ru/&quot;&gt;Mail.Ru Cloud&lt;/a&gt;, I have to select MEGA as my favourite for 2014. Unlike Mail.Ru Cloud and OneDrive it has a perfectly integrated Linux client and 50 GB of space is enough to satisfy my needs for now, although I’m planning to switch to some premium plan in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;best-reading-services-kindlehttpsreadamazoncom-and-digghttpdiggcom&quot;&gt;Best reading services: &lt;a href=&quot;https://read.amazon.com/&quot;&gt;Kindle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://digg.com/&quot;&gt;Digg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s been a while since I’ve discovered Kindle ebook readers. I’m still thinking about whether should I buy one or not. In the meantime, I’m really enjoying reading books through the online interface of the Kindle reader. I have over 150 books in my library now thanks to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/freeebooks&quot;&gt;Free eBooks subreddit&lt;/a&gt; and a simple &lt;a href=&quot;https://ifttt.com/myrecipes/personal/17091741&quot;&gt;IFTTT recipe&lt;/a&gt; which sends me the daily digest of new posts. I haven’t payed a dime for any of the books in it and I have books that are probably worth more than $1,000 dollars by now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Digg is the perfect way for me to stay in touch with the latest news from my favourite blogs (such as those in my blogroll in the sidebar).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;best-multimedia-services-popcorn-timehttppopcorntimeio-spotifyhttpswwwspotifycomus-and-clementinehttpswwwclementine-playerorg&quot;&gt;Best multimedia services: &lt;a href=&quot;http://popcorntime.io/&quot;&gt;Popcorn Time&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.spotify.com/us/&quot;&gt;Spotify&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.clementine-player.org/&quot;&gt;Clementine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though I’m not a huge fan of pirating (I’m all about open source software and creative commons), the fact &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; that I live in a country where most of the movies and TV shows are not available. Popcorn Time really helps me to be in touch with my favourite TV shows and I’m loving the simplicity and the design of the application itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m from Bosnia &amp;amp; Herzegovina, a country with &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt; music streaming service &lt;em&gt;at all&lt;/em&gt;. That’s why I’ve had to wake the hacker inside of me and found a solution to run Spotify as my choice. Basically, I’m using &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vpnbook.com/freevpn&quot;&gt;OpenVPN&lt;/a&gt; once every 15 days to log into my Spotify account and then I enter a “vacation mode”, which enables me to run Spotify for the next 15 days. And Spotify does have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.spotify.com/int/download/other/&quot;&gt;Spotify for Linux Preview&lt;/a&gt; client which, although a bit unstable, does the job perfectly for me so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now, why am I including Clementine in this list? Well, it’s because of the Internet streaming option. I’m a big &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.di.fm/&quot;&gt;Digitally Imported&lt;/a&gt; fan for quite some time and recently I’ve started listening to &lt;a href=&quot;http://somafm.com/&quot;&gt;SomaFM&lt;/a&gt; in the background while I’m doing something productive. I’ve chosen Clementine because it’s the perfect &lt;em&gt;out-of-the-box&lt;/em&gt; solution for streaming those two services. In fact, I’m listening to my favourite Digitally Imported station called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.di.fm/bassnjackinhouse&quot;&gt;Bass &amp;amp; Jackin’ House&lt;/a&gt; right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;games-2048httpgabrielecirulligithubio2048-0h-h1http0hh1com-and-south-park-the-stick-of-truthhttpsenwikipediaorgwikisouthparkthestickoftruth&quot;&gt;Games: &lt;a href=&quot;http://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/&quot;&gt;2048&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://0hh1.com/&quot;&gt;0h H1&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Park:_The_Stick_of_Truth&quot;&gt;South Park: The Stick of Truth&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t have any desire to play any complicated graphical game anymore. I’ve started to be a fan of logical games such as 2048 and Oh H1. The reason why I’m loving these two games is because they’re pretty simple to play, and the fact is that I’m not playing them for hours like I’ve used to play games like &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldoftanks.eu/&quot;&gt;World of Tanks&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.2k.com/games/nba-2k15&quot;&gt;NBA by 2k Sports&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From time to time, everyone needs a good amount of laugh. That’s why I really enjoyed playing South Park video game. Simple graphical interface + a good amount of humour is the winning combination in my case. I really wish that there’s a Linux version of it.&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Wow, this is the first time (although I can’t guarantee you that it will be the last) that I’m going to share with you a story that was &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; written by myself. And there’s an excellent reason for that. I don’t think that I’ve read a single story (or an article if you please) that had so much influence on me about today’s technology. It was written by &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quinn_Norton&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quinn Norton&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and published in a book called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.shareconference.net/en/news/share-book&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Share This Book (2012)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.shareconference.net/en&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Share Foundation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Please, read it thoroughly. I promise you that you &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; be amazed by this astonishing piece of writing.&lt;/p&gt;

&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; ## **Advice for Living in this World**
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;
Every day is stranger than the last one.

Each of us has a point where we fall short, where we can’t go on at this mad pace. We ride the wave as long as we can until we start to drown in time and change, and nothing makes sense anymore. And then we fight back from that insanity. This is so common an experience, it’s practically a rite of passage in our new online lives.

Somewhere along the way our networks exceeded us. We spent 12,000 years carving civilization out of the wild, and at the very edge of
its most technical, most complex, most beautiful moment, it became wild again. Like a matryoshka doll of our human disasters, from within our safe, designed and managed world, we built forests of infinite darkness. In the spaces between our devices, we populated this new wild with the predatorial spirits we’d exterminated from the outer landscape. Once again we face disease, dark creatures, black magics, and the all-seeing eyes of evil gods, all in the worlds we’ve created between us, all embedded in our most logical and mathematical system.

Technological life is just becoming life, it takes the weird and violent paths of life. Our network is biologically complex, unpredictable, a state of nature. It’s obtaining the qualities of forests, seas, galaxies -- filled with unearthly beauty, the apprehension of which will pull the breath from your lungs. And like nature, it’s complex and messy and every story, every single one, ends in death.

We need the oldest human tools for this new landscape. This is an age of elemental magic, battling wizards, and capricious gods. To make sense of this world, the routers and servers need their own nymphs and dryads, cable lays need the Shinto river gods, and we need to see Coyote and Raven passing through the application layer, bickering and upsetting the world as they go, but eventually bringing us pieces of the sun.

These are the opening moments of a mythic age, a polytheistic age. The drab but reliable monotheism, the old man God, and the careful
and slow secular rationalism he engendered, then fought, kept order in the world for a long time. God and Secular Rationalism were both
cut from the same cloth, mostly by reasonable men with proper ways to go about things that made the world predictable, rational, reasonable, hierarchal. But they couldn’t run fast enough to catch us in the 21st century. We overwhelmed them with a trillion tiny imps, little daemon servants that spawned, made trouble, and died before an ant could so much as shake its legs. We can still hear the Old Man and Rationalism screaming in the ever receding distance behind us, and before us, a world of chaos and weird constructed and endlessly self constructing from their technological inventions.

Our laptops will live in the corners of our domiciles, and we will take them with us, like the ancestral Roman housegods. We will come to see programming as magical incantations: cantrips that make small things happen, or great and long rituals that can stop time or turn the world from light to dark. We increasingly live in fear of these magics, not understanding them, but knowing there are those few gifted and sinister humans who do.

And the stories we will have, of them, of us! In the coming years we are going to need many gods to make sense of this world. We will
write many new myths to teach our loved ones and keep them safe. With no chance of understanding it all, we will need superstitions to guide us through the forests of the net. We face the old magic of ghosts in our machines, the sympathetic magic of DNA samples, and the voodoo of control in true names. Any sufficiently advanced magic turns out to be indistinguishable from technology.

I encourage you to pick up one of the old religions, and an amulet against the evil eye-- perhaps TOR + one of those lovely mediterranean glass beads. Read the old myths, and consider how they might be useful, how they are, in fact, true now. Find out the basic sigils that folks use in dark woods, and carry talismans against things that prey on network travelers in the downcycle night. We have ways for times like these, we just haven’t used them in a while. These are the things we need to dust off, gods and myths are
how we manage unmanageable nature-- even if we supposedly built it. Without them, we are lost, outdated, clinging to old ways and being harvested by evil things that eat the slow and careful. Nature, even this strange network nature we’ve created, does not reduce, it does not compress, and like all free things, it is terribly dangerous.

Rationalism had its run, but it’s just not rational anymore.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wordpress followers: 10&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Twitter followers: 103&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those stats are nothing special but I’m really proud of them. Now I’m starting to get over 50 visitors on a daily basis (in the last 15 days). After I got a pretty decent amount of initial attention, I’ve decided that this blog is a perfect way for me to express myself. That’s why I’m going to take &lt;a href=&quot;https://dailypost.wordpress.com/2014/12/29/blogging-101-january-registration/&quot;&gt;Blogging 101&lt;/a&gt;, a free online course (starting January the 5th) offered by Wordpress to further my knowledge of running a blog. After all, I love learning new things, which is the main reason why I started this blog in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve got a huge (and I really mean &lt;strong&gt;huge&lt;/strong&gt;) number of drafts prepared for 2015 so expect a new post at least two times a week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goals for 2015:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over 30,000 views (7 times more than in 2014)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over 20,000 visitors (8 times more than in 2014)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over 1,000 Twitter followers (10 times more than in 2014)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Loving the support I’m getting from you guys and those numbers definitely suggest to me that I should keep posting. Thanks to every single one of you guys and a happy 2015!&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So, everybody is sharing a list of something they came up with in the year behind them. I’m going to step it up a little. I present to you a very special list of mine. I represent to you the list of quotes that kept me motivated and inspired in 2014. This list is _very _special to me and I’ve decided to give it to you guys as a reward for reading my blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, here we go:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Latin: &lt;/strong&gt; Imperare sibi maximum imperium est. - To rule yourself is the ultimate power.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Duane Michals:&lt;/strong&gt;  Trust that little voice in your head that says “Wouldn’t it be interesting if…” And then do it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Friedrich Nietzsche:&lt;/strong&gt; In individuals, insanity is rare; but in groups, parties, nations, and epochs it is the rule.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Joseph Brodsky:&lt;/strong&gt; There are worse crimes than burning books. One of them is not reading them.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oscar Wilde:&lt;/strong&gt; Give a man mask and he’ll tell you the truth.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jim Morrison: &lt;/strong&gt; There can’t be any large-scale revolution until there’s a personal revolution, on an individual level. It’s got to happen inside first.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Napoleon Hill: &lt;/strong&gt; Patience, persistence and perspiration make an unbeatable combination for success.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mark Twain: &lt;/strong&gt; Never let your school interfere with your education.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mark Victor Hansen:&lt;/strong&gt;  Don’t wait until everything is just right. It will never be perfect. There will always be challenges, obstacles and less than perfect conditions. So what. Get started now. With each step you take, you will grow stronger and stronger, more and more skilled, more and more self-confident and more and more successful.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Michael Jordan:&lt;/strong&gt;  I can accept failure, everyone fails at something. But I can’t accept not trying.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mae West:&lt;/strong&gt;  You only live once, but if you do it right, once is enough.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Frank Zappa:&lt;/strong&gt;  If you end up with a boring miserable life because you listened to your mom, your dad, your teacher, your priest, or some guy on television telling you how to do your shit, then you deserve it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Will Smith:&lt;/strong&gt; You don’t try to build a wall. You don’t set out to build a wall. You don’t say, “I’m gonna build the biggest baddest greatest wall, that’s ever been build,”, you don’t start there. You say, “I’m gonna lay this brick, as perfectly as a brick can be laid,” and you do that, every single day. And soon you have a wall.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I’m going to represent to you a list of quotes taken from the book called &lt;a href=&quot;http://stlcurator.com/henry-goldkamp-what-the-hell-stl/&quot;&gt;What The Hell is Saint Louis Thinking? (2014)&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a book written by the city itself. It’s written by hundreds of citizens of Saint Louis and there are some quite interesting quotes there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We all drive on, walk past each other, not really knowing who we are. We’re all just strangers passing in the street, never stopping or taking the time.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is no reason to simply exist. You need to exist for a reason. That reason can be silly to everyone but you. Hold it dear to your heart. Never forget it and never deny it for it is the reason to keep sucking oxygen.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What you do in your life changes what someone else does in theirs, and that changes everything.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are all raindrops. We might seem small and insignificant but together we have the power of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fear keeps me from dreaming so I will not live my life in fear!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I’m going to share with you a song that kept me motivated in the 2014.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkCkCPfDmqQ&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy 2015. guys! Feel free to share some quote in the comments that influenced you the most in the year behind us!&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;We are all raindrops. We might seem small and insignificant, but together we have the power of the world.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a quote by an unknown author from a book called &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://stlcurator.com/henry-goldkamp-what-the-hell-stl/&quot;&gt;What The Hell is Saint Louis Thinking? (2014)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. It’s an excellent book and I suggest you to read it. Oh, and did I mention that it’s free?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really think that this quote really covers it all. We all shape the world somehow. Maybe we did something important today, and maybe we didn’t. But even if we didn’t, we might have influenced the world in some indirect way, by bothering someone with our problems and taking their time that might have been spent doing something that might influence the world in a much larger way, or by giving some kind of a motivation to someone which will help him to do something significant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I keep hearing that “&lt;em&gt;I want to change the world&lt;/em&gt;” cliché and frankly, I’m sick of it. It’s not about changing the world, changing the world is something that you do &lt;em&gt;while you’re thinking about changing the world&lt;/em&gt;. It’s about changing the world &lt;em&gt;as much as you can&lt;/em&gt;. It’s about broadening your change to a much higher spectrum than the average person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every action that we take our ancestors took helped to the design the world we live in today. And we need to be quite careful because actions we do &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt; will design the future for our future generations. And every action counts, be it a coffee with someone, writing this, programming something, going to a conference, spending the night drinking, or anything in between.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m going to end this with one more quote. I can’t remember where I read it and searching for it on the Internet did not gave me any usable result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;A man has two deaths. The first time when he physically dies, and the second time when his name is mentioned for the last time.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://r3bl.github.io/en/every-one-of-us-changes-the-world-in-one-way-or-another/&quot;&gt;Every One of Us Changes the World in One Way or Another&lt;/a&gt; was originally published by Aleksandar Todorović at &lt;a href=&quot;https://r3bl.github.io&quot;&gt;Aleksandar Todorović&lt;/a&gt; on December 27, 2014.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

  <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://aleksandartodorovic.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/openbaylogo.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://aleksandartodorovic.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/openbaylogo.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Open Bay logo&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;OK, so, as you probably already know, the official Pirate Bay was shut down 10 days ago. There are plenty of articles already covering this subject. I already stated &lt;a href=&quot;https://aleksandartodorovic.wordpress.com/2014/12/14/is-it-time-for-the-pirate-bay-to-disappear-for-good/&quot;&gt;my opinion on Pirate Bay disappearing for good&lt;/a&gt;, where &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.brokep.com/2014/12/09/the-pirate-bay-down-forever/&quot;&gt;I agreed with Peter Sunde&lt;/a&gt; (co-founder and ex-spokesperson of the Pirate Bay).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are already some non-legit Pirate Bay clones &lt;a href=&quot;http://torrentfreak.com/fake-pirate-bay-lies-to-press-and-fakes-user-uploads-141215/&quot;&gt;like this one&lt;/a&gt;, the Pirate Bay &lt;a href=&quot;http://torrentfreak.com/the-pirate-bay-has-not-been-resurrected-yet-141210/&quot;&gt;has not been ressurrected - yet&lt;/a&gt;, the Pirate Bay crew itself &lt;a href=&quot;http://torrentfreak.com/pirate-bay-crew-responds-to-the-raid-copies-and-the-future-141215/&quot;&gt;does not know&lt;/a&gt; will the Pirate Bay come online or not, and researchers &lt;a href=&quot;http://torrentfreak.com/bittorrent-anonymous-and-impossible-to-shut-down-141218/&quot;&gt;are currently working on&lt;/a&gt; making BitTorrent anonymous and impossible to shut down. It’s pretty obvious that the copyright industry &lt;a href=&quot;http://torrentfreak.com/how-to-learn-absolutely-nothing-in-fifteen-years-by-the-copyright-industry-141214/&quot;&gt;has learned absolutely nothing&lt;/a&gt; in the least fifteen years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The system now is messed up, but that &lt;a href=&quot;http://torrentfreak.com/pirate-bay-shutdown-doesnt-stop-people-sharing-141216/&quot;&gt;hasn’t stopped people from sharing&lt;/a&gt; using their favorite technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;presenting-open-bay&quot;&gt;Presenting: Open Bay&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Out of all those alternatives that came online after the raid, one really stands out and it’s called &lt;a href=&quot;https://oldpiratebay.org/&quot;&gt;Old Pirate Bay&lt;/a&gt;. So, why &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; did it stand out? Well, the whole point is that this copy is from a reputable source (&lt;a href=&quot;http://isohunt.to/&quot;&gt;isoHunt&lt;/a&gt;). Now, isoHunt is taking one step further by doing something Pirate Bay should have done a long time ago: they released the source code of Old Pirate Bay to the public and called it &lt;a href=&quot;http://openbay.isohunt.to/&quot;&gt;The Open Bay&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can find all of the source code in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/isohuntto/openbay/&quot;&gt;GitHub repository&lt;/a&gt;. You can host your own version of the Pirate Bay on your private server. You can even create your local torrent search engine, something I will try to do (if I manage to do that, there will be a tutorial on my blog on how to do that).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The point of doing this is simple: making pirates impossible to stop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;issues&quot;&gt;Issues&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, this brigs up so many issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How will we know what site is legit?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How will we update our torrent database?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How will we know what site does have an updated version of the torrent database?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These issues are yet to be resolved. If you do have some suggestions, leave them in the comments bellow or &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/isohuntto/openbay/issues/new&quot;&gt;create an issue&lt;/a&gt; on the repository itself. Lets make pirating impossible to stop together!&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">&lt;h3 id=&quot;uvod&quot;&gt;Uvod&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Svako od nas se bar u jednom trenutku života zamislio kakav je osjećaj biti haker? Možda ste i pokušali da istražite malo tu temu, a nemate dovoljno dobro znanje engleskog jezika da bi pratili engleske tutorijale? Možda imate druga koji je vidio da koristite Linux i odma je pomislio da ste haker? Možda vodite blog post i dobijate konstanta pitanja tipa “Kako da hakujem Fejsbuk od svoje bivše”?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukoliko spadate u bilo koju od ovih skupina, velike su šanse da nemate baš dovoljno živaca, motivacije i želje da objašnjavate svakome šta znači ovaj pojam. Zbog toga sam odlučio da sve postove domaćih autora sakupim na jedno mjesto, tako da od sada kada god dobijete slično pitanje možete sagovorniku poslati jedan link i završiti sa diskusijom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;predstavljam-vam-kako-postati-hakerhttpsgithubcomaleksandar-todorovickako-postati-haker-repozitorij&quot;&gt;Predstavljam vam &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/aleksandar-todorovic/kako-postati-haker&quot;&gt;kako-postati-haker&lt;/a&gt; repozitorij&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ideja ovog repozitorija jeste da se na jednom mjestu objave linkovi prema svim tekstovima domaćih autora (bili oni na “našem” jeziku ili na engleskom) na ovu temu, da se poređaju smisleno i pravilno grupišu. Na ovaj način se kreira jedinstvena lista tekstova preko koje nove osobe mogu da nauče nešto više o ovom pojmu, te se na taj način skida teret sa nas ostalih da prelazimo iste teme više puta i oslobađa nam se vrijeme da radimo neke bitnije stvari (tipa rekompajliranje kernela).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Repozitorij sadrži samo linkove prema teksovima. Na taj način piscima nije uskraćen broj posjeta na njihovim web stranicama. Pored svakog teksta se nalazi i naziv autora, te link prema njegovoj službenoj web stranici.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;budui-planovi&quot;&gt;Budući planovi&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trenutno imam samo jedan plan za budućnost ovog projekta, a taj plan jeste da listu postavim na sopstveni host umjesto da se listi pristupa GitHub repozotorij. Pošto trenutno nemam iznajmljen vlastiti host, kreiraću GitHub stranicu za projekat i predstaviti ga tamo u međuvremenu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;kako-doprinijeti-projektu&quot;&gt;Kako doprinijeti projektu?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doprinijeti projektu možete na više načina. Prvi način svakako jeste da pronađete tekstove na ovu temu i dodate ih na listu (ukoliko ne znate kako, jednostavno me &lt;a href=&quot;&amp;#109;&amp;#097;&amp;#105;&amp;#108;&amp;#116;&amp;#111;:&amp;#097;&amp;#108;&amp;#101;&amp;#107;&amp;#115;&amp;#097;&amp;#110;&amp;#100;&amp;#097;&amp;#114;&amp;#046;&amp;#116;&amp;#111;&amp;#100;&amp;#111;&amp;#114;&amp;#111;&amp;#118;&amp;#105;&amp;#099;&amp;#064;&amp;#109;&amp;#097;&amp;#105;&amp;#108;&amp;#046;&amp;#114;&amp;#117;&quot;&gt;kontaktirajte&lt;/a&gt; i ja ću to odraditi umjesto vas). Možete da dijelite ovaj repozitorij ili pišete o njemu pa da na taj način više ljudi sazna za njega. Možete da pišete originalan sadržaj na ovu temu da popunite praznine. Možete da mi pomognete da napravim web stranicu projekta učestvovanjem u izradi HTML verzije stranice ili dijeljenjem svojih hosting resursa za ovu svrhu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;tekstovi-koji-nee-biti-primljeni&quot;&gt;Tekstovi koji neće biti primljeni&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dozvoljeni su samo tekstovi prema kojima čitaoc nije dužan da se registruje na neki sajt da bi ih pročitao.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://r3bl.github.io/bs/dosta-kako-postati-haker-pitanja/&quot;&gt;Ljudi vam dosađuju pitanjima tipa kako postati haker?

  <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So, today I’m going to share with you a trick to DDoS a certain website by using Facebook’s notes feature. The process, although pretty simple, is a bit more complicated than previous posts I wrote in this series.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what do you need to do?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, first of all, you go to the target’s website and create a list with unique photos posted on that website. You put them in appropriate HTML tag like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;img src=”http://targetname/file?r=1” /&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;img src=”http://targetname/file?r=2” /&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;img src=”http://targetname/file?r=1000” /&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next thing you need to do is to write a note on &lt;a href=&quot;http://m.facebook.com/&quot;&gt;m.facebook.com&lt;/a&gt; (it’s a mobile version of Facebook).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, you need to duplicate that note a couple of times with one &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; several other Facebook accounts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After you’ve done that, all you need to do is to open that notes at the same time and watch the site go down. This process will generate thousands of HTTP requests in a couple of seconds to the target site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might want to check out previous posts in the series:&lt;/p&gt;
