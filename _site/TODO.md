# To-do

* Import all of my blog posts from [my previous blog](https://aleksandartodorovic.wordpress.com/) (hosted on Wordpress.com)
* Make some slight design changes.
  * Header should be centered.
  * The color of the header and footer should be different than the color of the main text.
  * Social media icons on a floating right sidebar.
  * Floating global menu?  
* Add links to my manifesto and my portfolio in the header.
