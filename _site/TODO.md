# To-do

* Find a better way to give credits to the source images.
* Add an archive by the language of the post inside of the navigation.
* Add a site with my alternatives.
* Sharing options need some re-design and I need to integrate more sharing options under every post.
* Create a subscribe option (by email, using RSS or something else) and link to it in a way that is easily accessible to the visitors.

# To consider

If an item on this list is checked, that means that I will probably do that in the near future.

- [ ] Changing icons to font-awesome?
- [x] Replacing images with the ones I pick?
- [x] Create a totally different repository for my music?
- [x] Move the entire portfolio to my Jekyll website?
- [ ] To add a blogroll or not? Useful articles [here](http://www.bloggersentral.com/2012/10/do-you-really-need-blogroll.html), [here](http://www.blogworld.com/2010/08/17/to-blogroll-or-not-to-blogroll/) and [here](http://www.chrisg.com/another-good-reason-to-not-have-a-blogroll/).
- [ ] Create a completely different home page that will have links to my latest posts, my music, my portfolio...
- [x] To create a some sort of "special thanks to..." page (or a post) where I will mention everyone who contributed to the overall design of the site in some way.
