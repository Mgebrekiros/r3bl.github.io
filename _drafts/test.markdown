So, here I am, awake at almost 6 AM, lighting a cigarette in my bedroom, and I have quite literally tears in my eyes. The reason? I re-watched a documentary called The Internet's Own Boy.

I'm not a very sensitive man. Really, I'm not. I don't usually have a lot of compassion to people no matter what they did. But I do have a special bond with with one of the true geniuses of our time. I can't help it. I feel sorry we lost such a hero. His story should never be forgotten.

Here I am, writing my blog, using the tools such as Creative Commons to share my articles, using the RSS feeds to connect with people. To learn. To educate myself far beyond what school has ever taught me. And I don't even realize that the Internet without one person, just _one single person_ who fought for it, would be much different than what it is today. We owe it all to Aaron Swartz.

I started my evening by picking up a book from my hard drive. It was a book I read somewhere in December last year. The book is called Share This Book and it's full of marvelous stories about sharing in the digital era. I promised the rest of the [Opensource.com](http://opensource.com) staff that I will write a review of this book for their third-in-a-row Summer reading list.

Then, I remembered that one essay from that book struck my attention in a _huge_ way. It is called Advice for Living in This World and its author is Quinn Norton. Now what I didn't realize at that time is who is Quinn Norton and it really didn't matter to me. The important thing was that this essay has made an impact to me at the time. So I re-read that essay and I was struck again by just how awesome the essay is.

Because there is something wrong with the ISP's equipment I use to connect to the Internet and it was like 1 or 2 AM when problem began, I had no way of contacting them. So I decided to watch some movie I had laying around my hard drive. By the time movie was finished, I thought that I will surely fall asleep. After all, this has happened a lot of times since I returned from my trip to the Netherlands (where I spent a month volunteering). But this time, it ended up differently.

Because of the impact the book left on me, I got attracted to my Documentaries sub-folder. Surely there's something interesting to re-watch there. I had decided to re-watch the documentary called The Internet's Own Boy. It's a documentary summarizing Aaron Swartz's life, his goals, his motivation and his work. There was something about Aaron Swartz that got my attention in the last couple of days. I just couldn't remember what exactly.

So while I was re-watching the movie, this female character appeared that wanted to share her story about Aaron's wife. Imagine my surprise when I realized that the name of that character was in fact Quinn Norton!

I found out that she was going through a rough time while her marriage was falling apart and she and Aaron became roommates. They had an intimate relationship. Her life, and probably the essay itself, was influenced by Aaron. And her essay had a huge impact on me. I just wasn't able to connect the dots.

I consider Aaron as one of the true geniuses of our time. I remember seeing him a couple of times on the television, but unfortunately, I was not fully aware of his life and work until he died.

After he committed suicide, I kind of became obsessed with him. I learned as much as I could about him and I read his stories which he shared on his blog (which is still online) when I needed to find the inspiration for whatever reason.

Now Aaron is not the only person who I became obsessed with after the person died. I became obsessed with George Carlin as well. But the way those two influenced my life is, of course, very different. After all, George is a comedian. Aaron, on the other hand, was an expert in the industry I'm trying to get in for years now. And I have to say this: Aaron is my role-model.

Of course, there's not much you can do when you're living in the fucked up country like I am. Nothing I do here could influence the world in the same way (h)ac(k)tivism could influence the world from the United States. I can't correct something wrong with the system I'm living in on my own. I don't have much of an impact. I'm just a student living in a country where everyone (and I do mean _everyone_) knows that there's a lot of things wrong with the country we're living in. But we cannot change it. We're divided. There's absolutely no way of uniting us because we're living in a country where three nations that form a _huge_ majority of the population were at war just 20 years ago. I love my country, no matter how fucked up it is, but I really do feel like I have this _huge_ challenge of making an impact by living in it. It's not easy to be recognized in a country that doesn't recognize _anyone_, no matter what their area of expertize is (unless, of course, you're a politician or a worldly-known football player).

But that's the thing. I'm living in an era where I'm not limited by this. I live in an era where all I need to do is to speak English pay like 10 Euros per month for my shitty Internet connection. That's all I need to do to learn _anything_ I want to learn.

Now I'm not saying that it was easy for me to fit into this new world. I got my first computer when I was 12 and I got the Internet connection at the age of 15. I still don't have a smartphone or a tablet device. All I have is one above-the-average laptop device and a shitty Internet connection. I'm still struggling to adapt in this vast amount of information I wasn't able to adapt to in my childhood, but I will find my own way.

I will find my way to make an impact on this world. To make something meaningful to people no matter where they are. To leave something behind when I'm no longer here. To make people remember me. And when I do, I will owe it all to Aaron.

Aaron is the person who taught me that one person could make a difference even if there's nobody backing me up in the beginning of the process. Aaron influenced the way I learn. Aaron is my inspiration. His blog continues to motivate me to do something big.

Although Aaron is no longer here, I feel honored I had spent 16 years breathing the same air as he did. He is no longer with us, but his legacy will live on. Through people like me. Through people that are just starting to leave their mark on the world.
