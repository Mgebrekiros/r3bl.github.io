## Writing experience

* I wrote an article for [Opensource.com](http://opensource.com/) called [A beginner's guide to GitHub](http://opensource.com/life/15/2/beginners-guide-github). This post managed to get over 10.000 views in just two days, became the [top article of the week](http://opensource.com/life/15/2/top-5-articles-week-february-20) and it was selected as the [top article posted in February 2015](http://opensource.com/community-report-march-2015). I've started volunteering as a Community Moderator for Opensource.com in June 2015 (more on that in the volunteering section below).
* I wrote a couple of articles for [LiBRE! Magazine](https://libre.lugons.org/) -- a regional free software magazine written in Serbian language.

## Volunteering experience

* **EVS Looking to Future: Springbos** (April 10th 2015 - May 9th 2015) - I've spent a month volunteering in the Netherlands as a part of the  [European Voluntery Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Voluntary_Service) project that took place in Rijswijk and Amsterdam, where I helped [Don Bosco Youth Center](http://donboscorijswijk.nl/) to create a fresh and interesting program for the children. We did all sorts of activities, so I have written a [blog post](https://r3bl.github.io/en/evs-netherlands-experience/) summarizing the project. It truly was a life changing experience.
