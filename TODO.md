# To-do

### Priorities

* I need to change the Jekyll theme.

### Other changes I need to do

* Make some design changes.
  * Header should be centered.
  * The color of the header and footer should be different than the color of the main text.
  * Floating global menu.
* Add links in the main menu:
  * [x] to my manifesto
  * [ ] to my portfolio
* Add a [blogroll](https://aleksandartodorovic.wordpress.com/friends/) (needs some work).
* Add a site with [my alternatives](https://aleksandartodorovic.wordpress.com/my-alternatives/).
* Separate posts by the language they're written in.
  * The sites are separated in two categories (/en and /bs)
  * All I need to do is to create two pages that will serve as a place where a visitor can see all of the post written in the specific language.
* Add a music section on the website.
* Create a stunning home page.
* Better integration with social media sites (implement my Tumblr profile)
* Sharing options below every single post.

### Changes I need to consider

* More creative ERROR 404 page?
* Social media icons on a floating right sidebar?
* To include a blogroll or not? Useful articles [here](http://www.bloggersentral.com/2012/10/do-you-really-need-blogroll.html), [here](http://www.blogworld.com/2010/08/17/to-blogroll-or-not-to-blogroll/) and [here](http://www.chrisg.com/another-good-reason-to-not-have-a-blogroll/).
