# To-do

* Add an archive by the language of the post inside of the navigation.
* Sharing options need some re-design and I need to integrate more sharing options under every post.
- Replacing images with the ones I pick?
- Create and maintain a totally different repository for my music. The repository is [here](https://github.com/r3bl/music).
- Create a completely different home page that will have links to my latest posts, my music, my portfolio...
- 2.0 version of my portfolio (redesign)
- To create a privacy policy, where I will clearly state that I am using Google Analytics (and the ways to circumvent that) and that I won't be serving ads on my blog what so ever.
