# To-do

* Make some design changes.
  * Header should be centered.
  * The color of the header and footer should be different than the color of the main text.
  * Floating global menu.
* Add links in the main menu:
  * [x] to my manifesto
  * [ ] to my portfolio
* Add a [blogroll](https://aleksandartodorovic.wordpress.com/friends/) (needs some work).
* Add a site with [my alternatives](https://aleksandartodorovic.wordpress.com/my-alternatives/).
* Separate posts by the language they're written in.
* Add a music section on the website.
* Create a stunning home page.
* Better integration with social media sites (implement my Tumblr profile)
* Sharing options below every single post.

# To be considered

* More creative ERROR 404 page?
* Social media icons on a floating right sidebar?
