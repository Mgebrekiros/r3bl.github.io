# To-do

* Figure out how to change the "LATEST POSTS" text on my homepage.
* Remove image source from the header.
* Figure out how to change my mail in the about navigation section.
* Create an about page.
* Categorize posts by the language they're written in.
* Add a language archive inside of the navigation.
* Decide what social media sites deserve to go in my about section of the navigation.
* Add links to my manifesto and my portfolio on the navigation.
* Add a site with my alternatives.
* Integrate Disqus, Google Analytics, Google Webmaster tools and something called Bing verification (whatever the hell that is)
* Sharing options need some re-design and I need to integrate more sharing options under every post.
* Think of the solution for the title of the post if the post title is too long ([example](https://r3bl.github.io//about me/free culture/linux/why-github-is-my-favorite-company/)).
* Create a subscribe option (by email, using RSS or something else)

# To consider

* Changing icons to font-awesome?
* Replacing images with the ones I pick?
* Create a totally different repository for my music?
* Move the entire portfolio to my Jekyll website?
* Replace the blog address to [aleksandar-todorovic.github.io](http://aleksandar-todorovic.github.io/) and use [r3bl.github.io](http://r3bl.github.io/) as a place for my music?
* To add a blogroll or not? Useful articles [here](http://www.bloggersentral.com/2012/10/do-you-really-need-blogroll.html), [here](http://www.blogworld.com/2010/08/17/to-blogroll-or-not-to-blogroll/) and [here](http://www.chrisg.com/another-good-reason-to-not-have-a-blogroll/).
* Create a completely different home page that will have links to my latest posts, my music, my portfolio...
* To create a some sort of "special thanks to..." page (or a post) where I will mention everyone who contributed to the overall design of the site in some way.
