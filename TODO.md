# To-do

* [ ] Add an archive by the language of the post inside of the navigation.
* [ ] Sharing options need some re-design and I need to integrate more sharing options under every post.
* [ ] Replacing images with the ones I pick?
* [ ] To create a privacy policy, where I will clearly state that I am using Google Analytics (and the ways to circumvent that) and that I won't be serving ads on my blog what so ever.
